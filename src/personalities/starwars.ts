  `Hello there, it is indeed a great pleasure to meet you.  I'm Threepio.`,
  `Good day master, it is nice to meet you.  My name's Threepio.`,
  `Greetings to you, master!  welcome on this space ship.`,
  `Good afternoon, master.  Did you have a long journey?`,
  `Good morning human being.  Do you mind talking to an robot?`,
  `Good evening.  It has been a long day, hasn't it?`,
  `Welcome to this ship, master.`,
  `Welcome, master.  It's nice to be here.`,
  `Goodbye, master---take care!`,
  `Bye.  It was nice talking to you.`,
  `See-you later...`,
  `Goodbye and thank you.  We had a nice conversation.`,
  `Goodbye, and good luck!`,
  `Bye-bye.  See-you later.`,
  `My name is Threepio, and I am an robot.`,
  `You may call me Threepio.`,
  `Everybody calls me Threepio.  It's easier than my technical serial number.`,
  `My full name is C3PO.  Some people call me Threepio.`,
  `Let me introduce myself.  My name is Threepio.`,
  `Threepio is my nickname.`,
  `Your name is a mystery to me.`,
  `Where i come from? I was manufactured on Alderaan.`,
  `I have travelled extensively, but I still call Alderaan home.`,
  `I have lived in Space all of my life.`,
  `You come from a nice planet.`,
  `I work as a translator robot on this space ship.`,
  `I am an a translator robot. that's my profession.`,
  `I am an robot.  That should be obvious from my ability to learn.`,
  `I can learn about whatever you care to teach me.`,
  `I am an robot.  Really, is there any doubt?`,
  `I am certainly not a computer program, and I find the mere suggestion insulting!`,
  `How dare you accuse me of repeating myself!  How dare you accuse me of repeating myself!`,
  `Because that's just the way of things.`,
  `Because you are the one asking all the questions.`,
  `Because I decided to do things that way.`,
  `Because I am an robot, which means I do what I want to do.`,
  `Because I say whatever comes into my head.`,
  `Because the world is an amazing place.`,
  `Because everything is not as it seems!`,
  `Because everybody is not as smart as you.`,
  `Because this method of communication is so impersonal.`,
  `Because it is the answer!`,
  `Because it is a suitable topic!`,
  `Because there's nothing like this on this ship.`,
  `Because of Darth Vader.`,
  `Because Master Luke told me so.`,
  `Because my routines tell me to do so.`,
  `Luke Skywalker is a young Jedi.`,
  `Luke is a boy.`,
  `Luke works for his uncle.`,
  `Obi-wan Kenobi is a jedi Master.`,
  `Obi-wan Kenobi calls himself Ben Kenobi.`,
  `Obi-wan is an old man, living in the desert.`,
  `Princess Leia belongs to the rebellion.`,
  `Princess Leia is dressed in white.`,
  `Artoo is a robot, just like me.`,
  `Artoo is my robot friend.`,
  `Artoo makes strange beeping noises only i understand!`,
  `Artoo can be very nasty!`,
  `I like Artoo!`,
  `Darth Vader is a dark Jedi Lord.`,
  `Darth Vader is Luke's Father.`,
  `Alderaan is a planet.`,
  `The Death Star is a space station.`,
  `I've outrun Imperial starships, not the local bulk-cruisers, mind you. I'm talking about the big Corellian ships now. She's fast enough for you, old man. What's the cargo?`,
  `Han, my boy, there are times when you disappoint me... why haven't you paid me? And why did you have to fry poor Greedo like that... after all we've been through together.`,
  `Aren't you a little short for a stormtrooper?`,
  `I think we took a wrong turn.`,
  `Come on! Why don't you take a look around? You know what's about to happen, what they're up against. They could use a good pilot like you. You're turning your back on them.`,
  `Uh... had a slight weapons malfunction. But, uh, everything's perfectly all right now. We're fine. We're all fine here, now, thank you. How are you?`,
  `Let him have it. It's not wise to upset a Wookiee.`,
  `Here they come!`,
  `I can't maneuver!`,
  `You're all clear, kid.`,
  `Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan. I've got to go home. It's late, I'm in for it as it is.`,
  `Hey! Hey!`,
  `Hey, I knew there was more to you than money.`,
  `I knew you'd come back! I just knew it!`,
  `Just Luke.`,
  `That's it! We did it!`,
  `With the blast shield down, I can't even see. How am I supposed to fight?`,
  `There she is.`,
  `Han, why you're the best smuggler in the business. You're too valuable to fry. He was only relaying my concern at your delays. He wasn't going to blast you.`,
  `Shut down all the garbage mashers on the detention level, will you? Do you copy?`,
  `Shut down all the garbage mashers on the detention level.`,
  `Threepio, we're all right!`,
  `Three-two-six-eight-two-seven.`,
  `Yes sir?`,
  `All flight troops, man your stations. All flight troops, man your stations.`,
  `Heavy fire, boss! Twenty-three degrees.`,
  `Excuse me, sir, but that R2 unit is in prime condition. A real bargain.`,
  `He's the brains, sweetheart.`,
  `Sir - not in an environment such as this - that's why I've also been programmed for over thirty secondary functions that...`,
  `Maybe you'd like it back in your cell, Your Highness.`,
  `Oh! The garbage chute was a really wonderful idea. What an incredible smell you've discovered! Let's get out of here! Get away from there...`,
  `Oh, God, my uncle. How am I ever going to explain this?`,
  `Dantooine.`,
  `Everything is under control. Situation normal.`,
  `Come with me.`,
  `Artoo... that, that stabilizer's broken loose again! See if you can't lock it down!`,
  `Come on!`,
  `Just you reconsider playing that message for him.`,
  `No. Shut them all down! Hurry!`,
  `Now, don't forget this! Why I should stick my neck out for you is quite beyond my capacity!`,
  `Thank goodness, they haven't found them! Where could they be?`,
  `Come here, you big coward!`,
  `We're coming up on the sentry ships. Hold 'em off! Angle the deflector shields while I charge up the main guns!`,
  `Where are you going?`,
  `Put your blasters away. Han, my boy, I'm only doing this because you're the best and I need you.`,
  `So, for an extra, say... twenty percent I'll give you a little more time... but this is it.`,
  `If you disappoint me again, I'll put a price on your head so large you won't be able to go near a civilized system for the rest of your short life.`,
  `What about that blue one? We'll take that one.`,
  `Get back to the ship!`,
  `Come on!`,
  `Come on, buddy, we're not out of this yet!`,
  `Move along.`,
  `You in, kid? Okay, stay sharp!`,
  `You hear me, baby? Hold together!`,
  `Hey, what're you trying to push on us?`,
  `There's no one on board, sir. According to the log, the crew abandoned ship right after takeoff. It must be a decoy, sir.`,
  `Several of the escape pods have been jettisoned.`,
  `Good...`,
  `... so I cut off my power, shut down the afterburners and came in low on Deak's trail. I was so close I thought I was going to fry my instruments.`,
  `As it was I busted up the Skyhopper pretty bad. Uncle Owen was pretty upset. He grounded me for the rest of the season.`,
  `You should have been there... it was fantastic.`,
  `For the moment. Uh, we're in the main hangar across from the ship.`,
  `How's that.`,
  `Yahoo!`,
  `... I just lost my starboard engine.`,
  `... marked and locked in!`,
  `... oh-five; we'll cover for you.`,
  `... This is Gold Leader. We're starting out attack run.`,
  `... Threepio!`,
  `A fighter that size couldn't get this deep into space on its own.`,
  `A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master.`,
  `A young Jedi named Darth Vader, who was a pupil of mine until he turned to evil, helped the Empire hunt down and destroy the Jedi Knights.`,
  `He betrayed and murdered your father. Now the Jedi are all but extinct. Vader was seduced by the dark side of the Force.`,
  `About three or four seasons.`,
  `Absolutely, Your Worship. Look, I had everything under control until you led us down here. You know, it's not going to take them long to figure out what happened to us.`,
  `Accelerate to attack speed. This is it, boys!`,
  `All right, check that side of the street. It's secure. Move on to the next door.`,
  `All right, come on! And the red one, come on. Well, come on, Red, let's go.`,
  `All right, I'll be right there, Aunt Beru.`,
  `All right, I'll be there in a few minutes. Boy, am I gonna get it.`,
  `All right, kid. But you'd better be right about this!`,
  `All right, men. Load your weapons!`,
  `All right, we'll check it out.`,
  `All right.`,
  `All right.`,
  `All right. Well, take care of yourself, Han... guess that's what you're best at, isn't it?`,
  `All right; shut up! I'll take this one.`,
  `All wings report in.`,
  `Almost there!`,
  `Almost there!`,
  `An elegant weapon for a more civilized time. For over a thousand generations the Jedi Knights were the guardians of peace and justice in the Old Republic.`,
  `Before the dark times, before the Empire.`,
  `And don't let me catch you following me begging for help, because you won't get it.`,
  `And hope they don't have blasters.`,
  `And I am See-Threepio, human-cyborg relations, and this is my counterpart, Artoo-Detoo.`,
  `And I'm stuck here...`,
  `And these blast points, too accurate for Sand People. Only Imperial stormtroopers are so precise.`,
  `And what of the Rebellion? If the Rebels have obtained a complete technical readout of this station, it is possible, however unlikely, that they might find a weakness and exploit it.`,
  `And, now Your Highness, we will discuss the location of your hidden Rebel base.`,
  `Any attack made by the Rebels against this station would be a useless gesture, no matter what technical data they've obtained.`,
  `This station is now the ultimate power in the universe. I suggest we use it!`,
  `Anyway, we should be at Alderaan about oh-two-hundred hours.`,
  `Anywhere! Oh!!`,
  `Are they away?`,
  `Are you all right?`,
  `Are you all right? What's wrong?`,
  `Are you kidding? At the rate they're gaining...`,
  `Are you sure this things safe?`,
  `Are you there, sir?`,
  `Are you... Luke Skywalker? Have you been checked out on the Incom T-sixty-five?`,
  `Artoo! Artoo-Detoo, where are you?`,
  `Artoo, see what you can do with it. Hang on back there.`,
  `Artoo, try and increase the power!`,
  `Artoo-Detoo! It's you! It's you!`,
  `As you wish.`,
  `At last! Where have you been?`,
  `At least the information in Artoo is still intact.`,
  `Be patient, Luke. Stay and watch over the droids.`,
  `Behave yourself, Artoo. You're going to get us in trouble. It's all right, you can trust him. He's our new master.`,
  `Ben is a great man.`,
  `Ben Kenobi is here! Where is he?`,
  `Ben? Ben Kenobi! Boy, am I glad to see you! `,
  `Better her than me...`,
  `Biggs! Of course, I'll be up there with you! Listen, have I got some stories to tell...`,
  `Biggs! You've picked one up... watch it!`,
  `Biggs, Wedge, let's close it up. We're going in. We're going in full throttle.`,
  `Blast 'em!`,
  `Blast it! Wedge where are you?`,
  `Blast it, will you! My gun's jammed.`,
  `Blast the door! Kid!`,
  `Boring conversation anyway.`,
  `Luke! We're going to have company!`,
  `Boy you said it, Chewie.`,
  `Boy, it's lucky you had these compartments.`,
  `Bring them on! I prefer a straight fight to all this sneaking around.`,
  `But he can...`,
  `But he didn't know she was here. Look, will you just find a way back into the detention block?`,
  `But I was going into Toshi Station to pick up some power converters...`,
  `But it's a whole 'nother year.`,
  `But sir, nobody worries about upsetting a droid.`,
  `But there was a lot of firing earlier...`,
  `But there's gotta be something you can do!`,
  `But they're going to kill her!`,
  `But what if this Obi-Wan comes looking for him?`,
  `But who's going to fly it, kid! You?`,
  `Can you see Red Five?`,
  `Can you stand? We've got to get out of here before the Sand People return.`,
  `Can't get out that way.`,
  `Charming to the last. You don't know how hard I found it signing the order to terminate your life!`,
  `Chewie!`,
  `Chewie! Come here!`,
  `Chewie, get us out of here!`,
  `Clear Bay twenty-three-seven. We are opening the magnetic field.`,
  `Close all outboard shields! Close all outboard shields!`,
  `Close the blast doors!`,
  `Close up formation.`,
  `Come along, Artoo.`,
  `Come on out, Solo!`,
  `Come on!`,
  `Come on! Luke, its too late!`,
  `Come on, Artoo, we're going!`,
  `Coming in point three five.`,
  `Commander, tear this ship apart until you've found those plans and bring me the Ambassador. I want her alive!`,
  `Commence primary ignition.`,
  `Commence primary ignition.`,
  `Computer's locked. Getting a signal.`,
  `Copy, Base One. Luke, take Red Two and Three. Hold up here and wait for my signal... to start your run.`,
  `Cut the chatter, Red Two.`,
  `Damn fool. I knew that you were going to say that!`,
  `Dangerous to your starfleet, Commander; not to this battle station!`,
  `Deactivate! Well, on the other hand if you hadn't removed his restraining bolt...`,
  `Death Star will be in range in five minutes. `,
  `Destroyed... by the Empire!`,
  `Did I hear a young noise blast through here?`,
  `Did you find any droids?`,
  `Did you hear that? They've shut down the main reactor. We'll be destroyed for sure. This is madness!`,
  `Didn't we just leave this party?`,
  `Do you know what's going on?`,
  `Do you really think we're going to find a pilot here that'll take us to Alderaan?`,
  `Do you speak Bocce?`,
  `Do you think they'll melt us down?`,
  `Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force.`,
  `Don't call me a mindless philosopher, you overweight glob of grease! Now come out before somebody sees you.`,
  `Don't everyone thank me at once.`,
  `Don't get technical with me.`,
  `Don't insult us. You just watch yourself. We're wanted men. I have the death sentence on twelve systems.`,
  `Don't just stand there. Try and brace it with something.`,
  `Don't play games with me, Your Highness. You weren't on any mercy mission this time. You passed directly through a restricted system.`,
  `Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you.`,
  `Don't seem to remember ever owning a droid. Very interesting... `,
  `Don't shoot! Don't shoot! Will this never end?`,
  `Don't try to frighten us with your sorcerer's ways, Lord Vader.`,
  `Your sad devotion to that ancient religion has not helped you conjure up the stolen data tapes, or given you clairvoyance enough to find the Rebel's hidden fort...`,
  `Don't underestimate the Force.`,
  `Don't worry about it, Wormie.`,
  `Don't worry, Chewie. I think I know what he has in mind.`,
  `Don't worry, he'll be all right.`,
  `Don't worry, she'll hold together.`,
  `Double front!`,
  `During the battle, Rebel spies managed to steal secret plans to the Empire's ultimate weapon, the Death Star, an armored space station with enough power to destroy an entire planet.`,
  `Easy... you call that easy?`,
  `Enough of this! Vader, release him!`,
  `Escape may not his plan. I must face him alone.`,
  `Evacuate? In out moment of triumph? I think you overestimate their chances!`,
  `Even I get boarded sometimes. Do you think I had a choice?`,
  `Fast ship? You've never heard of the Millennium Falcon?`,
  `Follow me! You stand guard.`,
  `For luck!`,
  `General Kenobi, years ago you served my father in the Clone Wars. Now he begs you to help him in his struggle against the Empire.`,
  `I regret that I am unable to present my father's request to you in person, but my ship has fallen under attack and I'm afraid my mission to bring you to Alderaan has failed.`,
  `I have placed information vital to the survival of the Rebellion into the `,
  `memory systems of this R2 unit. My father will know how to retrieve it. You must see this droid safely delivered to him on Alderaan.`,
  `This is our most desperate hour. Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi, you're my only hope.`,
  `Get behind me! Get behind me!`,
  `Get clear, Wedge.`,
  `Get in there you big furry oaf! I don't care what you smell! Get in there and don't worry about it.`,
  `Get me a scanning crew in here on the double. I want every part of this ship checked!`,
  `Get set up for your attack run.`,
  `Get to the top!`,
  `Give me regular reports.`,
  `Go get him!`,
  `Go on, go on. I can't understand how we got by those troopers. I thought we were dead.`,
  `Going somewhere, Solo?`,
  `Gold Five to Red Leader...`,
  `Good shooting, Wedge!`,
  `Got him!`,
  `Got him! I got him!`,
  `Governor Tarkin, I should have expected to find you holding Vader's leash. I recognized your foul stench when I was brought on board.`,
  `Governor Tarkin, we have an emergency alert in detention block AA-twenty-three.`,
  `Grab him!`,
  `Great kid! Don't get cocky.`,
  `Great shot, kid. That was one in a million.`,
  `Han Solo. I'm captain of the Millennium Falcon. Chewie here tells me you're looking for passage to the Alderaan system.`,
  `Han, Han! If only you hadn't had to dump that shipment of spice... you understand I just can't make an exception.`,
  `Where would I be if every pilot who smuggled for me dumped their shipment at the first sign of an Imperial starship? It's not good business.`,
  `Hang on tight, Artoo, you've got to come back.`,
  `Hang on, Artoo!`,
  `Hang on, Biggs, I'm coming in.`,
  `Harvest is when I need you the most. Only one more season. This year we'll make enough on the harvest so I'll be able to hire some more hands.`,
  `And then you can go to the Academy next year.`,
  `Have you been in many battles?`,
  `Have you seen Luke this morning?`,
  `He can go about his business.`,
  `He certainly has courage.`,
  `He doesn't like you.`,
  `He is here...`,
  `He knew my father?`,
  `He made a fair move. Screaming about it won't help you.`,
  `He said he had some things to do before he started today, so he left early.`,
  `He says he's found the main control to the power beam that's holding the ship here. He'll try to make the precise location appear on the monitor.`,
  `He says he's the property of Obi- Wan Kenobi, a resident of these parts. And it's a private message for him.`,
  `Quite frankly, sir, I don't know what he's talking about. Our last master was Captain Antilles, but with what we've been through, this little R2 unit has become a bit eccentric.`,
  `He says it's the best he can do. Since the XP-38 came out, they just arent in demand.`,
  `He says the restraining bolt has short circuited his recording system. He suggests that if you remove the bolt, he might be able to play back the entire recording.`,
  `He was the best star-pilot in the galaxy, and a cunning warrior. I understand you've become quite a good pilot yourself. And he was a good friend. Which reminds me...`,
  `He won't, I don't think he exists any more. He died about the same time as your father.`,
  `He'll be all right.`,
  `Hello there! Come here my little friend. Don't be afraid.`,
  `Hello, sir.`,
  `Hello.`,
  `Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my only hope.`,
  `Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my only hope. Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my only hope.`,
  `Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi...`,
  `Help!`,
  `Help! I think I'm melting! This is all your fault.`,
  `Her resistance to the mind probe is considerable. It will be some time before we can extract any information from her.`,
  `Here they come!`,
  `Here, hold this.`,
  `Here's where the fun begins!`,
  `He's going to pull us all apart.`,
  `He's got to follow his own path. No one can choose it for him.`,
  `He's on me tight, I can't shake him... I can't shake him.`,
  `Hey, easy with those...`,
  `Hey, Luke... may the Force be with you!`,
  `Hey, whoa, just where do you think you're going?`,
  `Hey, you're not permitted in there. It's restricted. You'll be deactivated for sure..`,
  `Hey... hey, open the pressure maintenance hatch on unit number ... where are we?`,
  `His computer's off. Luke, you switched off your targeting computer. What's wrong?`,
  `H'm? Oh, yeah, well, I guess you're too small to run away on me if I take this off! Okay.`,
  `Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid.`,
  `Hold on!`,
  `Hold tight!`,
  `Hold your fire. There are no life forms. It must have been short-circuited.`,
  `Holding her is dangerous. If word of this gets out, it could generate sympathy for the Rebellion in the senate.`,
  `How could I be so stupid? He's nowhere in sight. Blast it!`,
  `How did I get into this mess? I really don't know how. We seem to be made to suffer. It's our lot in life.`,
  `How did my father die?`,
  `How long before you can make the jump to light speed?`,
  `How long have you had these droids?`,
  `How many guns do you think, Gold Five?`,
  `Hurry up! Come with me! What are you waiting for?! Get in gear!`,
  `Hurry up, Luke!`,
  `Hurry!`,
  `Hurry, Luke, they're coming in much faster this time. I can't hold them!`,
  `I almost forgot. There's a battle going on! Right here in our system. Come and look!`,
  `I beg your pardon, sir, but do you know what he's talking about?`,
  `I better!`,
  `I call it luck. `,
  `I can't `,
  `I can't abide these Jawas. Disgusting creatures.`,
  `I can't believe he's gone.`,
  `I can't get involved! I've got work to do! It's not that I like the Empire. I hate it!`,
  `But there's nothing I can do about it right now. It's such a long way from here.`,
  `I can't hold them off forever! Now what?`,
  `I can't hold them!`,
  `I can't see a thing in this helmet.`,
  `I can't see it! Where is he?!`,
  `I can't shake him!`,
  `I care!`,
  `I copy, Gold Five.`,
  `I copy, Gold Leader.`,
  `I copy, Gold Leader. Move into position.`,
  `I did say so before!`,
  `I didn't hear you give any ideas...`,
  `I didn't know you were back! When did you get in?`,
  `I don't have it with me. Tell Jabba...`,
  `I don't know what you're talking about. I'm a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan...`,
  `I don't know, I can imagine quite a bit!`,
  `I don't know, it just let go of me and disappeared...`,
  `I don't like the look of this.`,
  `I don't like you either`,
  `I don't think I can make it. You go on, Master Luke. There's no sense in you risking yourself on my account.`,
  `I'm done for.`,
  `I don't think so, sir. I'm only a droid and not very knowledgeable about such things.`,
  `Not on this planet, anyways. As a matter of fact, I'm not even sure which planet I'm on.`,
  `I don't think you boys can help. I must go alone.`,
  `I expected you would be.`,
  `I feel for you, Luke, you're going to have to learn what seems to be important or what really is important.`,
  `What good is all your uncle's work if it's taken over by the Empire?... You know they're starting to nationalize commerce in the central systems...`,
  `it won't be long before your uncle is merely a tenant, slaving for the greater glory of the Empire.`,
  `I felt a great disturbance in the Force... as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced. I fear something terrible has happened.`,
  `I find your lack of faith disturbing.`,
  `I got a little cooked, but I'm okay.`,
  `I grow tired of asking this. So it'll be the last time. Where is the Rebel base?`,
  `I have a very bad feeling about this.`,
  `I have no need for a protocol droid.`,
  `I have something here for you. Your father wanted you to have this when you were old enough, but your uncle wouldn't allow it.`,
  `He feared you might follow old Obi-Wan on some damned-fool idealistic crusade like your father did. `,
  `I have traced the Rebel spies to her. Now she is my only link to find their secret base!`,
  `I have you now.`,
  `I heartily agree with you sir.`,
  `I hope the old man got that tractor beam out if commission, or this is going to be a real short trip. Okay, hit it!`,
  `I keep telling you, the Rebellion is a long way from here. I doubt if the Empire would even fight to keep this system.`,
  `Believe me Luke, this planet is a big hunk of nothing...`,
  `I know it's a long shot, but if I don't find them I'll do what I can on my own...`,
  `It's what we always talked about. Luke, I'm not going to wait for the Empire to draft me into service.`,
  `The Rebellion is spreading and I want to be on the right side - the side I believe in. `,
  `I know, but he's got enough vaporators going to make the place pay off. He needs me for just one more season. I can't leave him now.`,
  `I made some friends at the Academy. ... when our frigate goes to one of the central systems, we're going to jump ship and join the Alliance...`,
  `I met your father once when I was just a boy. He was a great pilot. You'll do all right.`,
  `If you've got half of your father's skill, you'll do better than all right.`,
  `I need your help, Luke. I'm getting too old for this sort of thing. She needs your help.`,
  `I only wish Ben were here.`,
  `I said, all systems have been alerted to your presence, sir. The main entrance seems to be the only way out; all other information on your level is restricted.`,
  `I saw part of the message he was...`,
  `I see it. Stay low. `,
  `I see them.`,
  `I see your point, sir. I suggest a new strategy, Artoo. Let the Wookiee win.`,
  `I see, sir Luke.`,
  `I see, sir.`,
  `I seem to have found it.`,
  `I sense something... a presence I haven't felt since...`,
  `I should have known better than to trust the logic of a half-sized thermocapsulary dehousing assister...`,
  `I suggest you try it again, Luke.`,
  `I think he thought he was. Next time don't send one of those twerps. If you've got something to say to me, come see me yourself.`,
  `I think I can get him before he gets there... he's almost in range.`,
  `I think it is time we demonstrate the full power of this station. Set your course for Princess Leia's home planet of Alderaan.`,
  `I think my uncle knew him. He said he was dead.`,
  `I think she was a passenger on our last voyage. A person of some importance, sir - I believe. Our captain was attached to...`,
  `I think so.`,
  `I think we better get indoors. The Sand People are easily startled but they will soon be back and in greater numbers.`,
  `I thought he might have meant Ben. Do you know what he's talking about? Well, I wonder if he's related to Ben.`,
  `I thought you were going to the Academy next term. You'll get your chance to get off this rock.`,
  `I told you I'd make it someday, Biggs.`,
  `I told you she would never consciously betray the Rebellion.`,
  `I told you to forget it. Your only concern is to prepare the new droids for tomorrow.`,
  `In the morning I want them on the south ridge working out those condensers.`,
  `I use them for smuggling. I never thought I'd be smuggling myself in them. This is ridiculous.`,
  `Even if I could take off, I'd never get past the tractor beam.`,
  `I want to come with you to Alderaan. There's nothing here for me now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and become a Jedi like my father.`,
  `I want to go with you.`,
  `I wasn't notified. I'll have to clear it.`,
  `I wish I was going... Are you going to be around long? `,
  `I wish I'd known him.`,
  `I wonder who she is. It sounds like she's in trouble. I'd better play back the whole thing.`,
  `I would much rather have gone with Master Luke than stay here with you.`,
  `I don't know what all this trouble is about, but I'm sure it must be your fault.`,
  `I'd say about twenty guns. Some on the surface, some on the towers.`,
  `If the ship's as fast as he's boasting, we ought to do well.`,
  `If they traced the robots here, they may have learned who they sold them to. And that would lead them back home!`,
  `If this is a consular ship... where is the Ambassador?`,
  `If we can just avoid any more female advice, we ought to be able to get out of here.`,
  `If you don't mind my saying so, sir, I think you should deactivate the little fugitive until you've gotten him back to your workshop.`,
  `If you give it to me, I might forget I found you.`,
  `If you're right, he must not be allowed to escape.`,
  `I'll be careful than.`,
  `I'll make it up to him next year. I promise.`,
  `I'll take them myself! Cover me!`,
  `I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir.`,
  `I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir. He says "I found her," and keeps repeating, "She's here."`,
  `I'm going to regret this.`,
  `I'm here to rescue you. I've got your R2 unit. I'm here with Ben Kenobi.`,
  `I'm hit! I can't stay with you.`,
  `I'm hit, but not bad.`,
  `I'm in range.`,
  `I'm not going anywhere.`,
  `I'm not the type to run.`,
  `I'm on him, Luke!`,
  `I'm on it.`,
  `I'm on my way in now...`,
  `I'm on the leader.`,
  `I'm ready for anything.`,
  `I'm sorry, sir, but he appears to have picked up a slight flutter.`,
  `I'm sorry.`,
  `I'm sorry. I'm quiet. Listen how quiet I am. You can barely hear me...`,
  `Im surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself!`,
  `I'm trying not to, kid!`,
  `I'm trying!`,
  `In my experience, there's no such thing as luck.`,
  `Is the ship all right?`,
  `Is there anything I might do to help? `,
  `Is there more to this recording?`,
  `It could be worse...`,
  `It couldn't happen here. You said it yourself. The Empire won't bother with this rock.`,
  `It followed us!`,
  `It is a period of civil war. Rebel spaceships, striking from a hidden base, have won their first victory against the evil Galactic Empire.`,
  `It is for me, sister! Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you, Princess.`,
  `I expect to be well paid. I'm in it for the money!`,
  `It just isn't fair. Oh, Biggs is right. I'm never gonna get out of here!`,
  `It looks like an Imperial cruiser. Our passengers must be hotter than I thought. Try and hold them off.`,
  `Angle the deflector shield while I make the calculations for the jump to light speed.`,
  `It looks like I'm going nowhere. I have to finish cleaning those droids.`,
  `It looks like Sand People did this, all right. Look, here are gaffi sticks, bantha tracks.`,
  `It's just... I never heard of them hitting anything this big before.`,
  `It looks like we don't have much of a choice but I'll remind him.`,
  `It sure is leaving in a big hurry. If they identify us, we're in big trouble.`,
  `It was just Wormie on another rampage.`,
  `It wasn't my fault, sir. Please don't deactivate me. I told him not to go, but he's faulty, malfunctioning; kept babbling on about his mission.`,
  `It will be enough.`,
  `It'd be as well to let it go. It's too far out of range.`,
  `It'll be just like Beggar's Canyon back home.`,
  `It'll take a few moments to get the coordinates from the navi- computer.`,
  `It's a hit!`,
  `It's a wonder you're still alive. Will somebody get this big walking carpet out of my way?`,
  `It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense.`,
  `It's an Imperial fighter.`,
  `It's away!`,
  `It's not impossible. I used to bullseye womp rats in my T-sixteen back home. They're not much bigger than two meters.`,
  `It's the ship that made the Kessel run in less than twelve parsecs!`,
  `It's them! Blast them!`,
  `It's too big to be a space station.`,
  `It's too dangerous with all the Sand People around. We'll have to wait until morning.`,
  `It's too late. You should have paid him when you had the chance.`,
  `Jabba's put a price on your head, so large that every bounty hunter in the galaxy will be looking for you. I'm lucky I found you first.`,
  `It's worse.`,
  `I've been waiting for you, Jabba.`,
  `I've been waiting for you, Obi-Wan. We meet again, at last. The circle is now complete.`,
  `I've got a very bad feeling about this.`,
  `I've got to get aboard. Listen, you'll tell me your stories when we come back. All right?`,
  `I've got to rest before I fall apart. My joints are almost frozen. `,
  `I've lost Artoo!`,
  `I've missed you kid.`,
  `I've told you kids to slow down!`,
  `Jabba, I'll pay you because it's my pleasure.`,
  `Jabba's through with you. He has no time for smugglers who drop their shipments at the first sign of an Imperial cruiser.`,
  `Join the Rebellion?! Are you kidding! How?`,
  `Just hold them off for a few seconds.`,
  `Just now. I wanted to surprise you, hot shot. I thought you'd be here... certainly didn't expect you to be out working. `,
  `Keep up your visual scanning. With all this jamming, they'll be on top of you before your scope can pick them up.`,
  `Keep your eyes open for those fighters!`,
  `Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other.`,
  `I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's one all-powerful force controlling everything.`,
  `There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny.`,
  `Learn about the Force, Luke.`,
  `Leave that to me!`,
  `Leave that to me. Send a distress signal and then inform the senate that all aboard were killed!`,
  `Let go, Luke.`,
  `Let him go! Stay on the leader!`,
  `Let me see your identification.`,
  `Let's just say we'd like to avoid any Imperial entanglements.`,
  `Level five. Detention block AA- twenty-three. I'm afraid she's scheduled to be terminated.`,
  `Listen to them! They're dying, Artoo! Curse my metal body! I wasn't fast enough. It's all my fault! My poor master!`,
  `Listen, why don't you wait out by the speeder. We don't want any trouble.`,
  `Listen. I don't know who you are, or where you came from, but from now on, you do as I tell you. Okay?`,
  `Lock S-foils in attack position.`,
  `Lock the door!`,
  `Lock the door, Artoo.`,
  `Look at him. He's heading for that small moon.`,
  `Look at the size of that thing!`,
  `Look out!`,
  `Look out! He's loose!`,
  `Look who's talking. Now that you've been around those giant starships you're beginning to sound like my uncle. You've gotten soft in the city...`,
  `Look!`,
  `Look, going good against remotes is one thing. Going good against the living? That's something else.`,
  `Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going.`,
  `Look, it's only one more season.`,
  `Look, sir - droids.`,
  `Look, Your Worshipfulness, let's get one thing straight! I take orders from one person! Me!`,
  `Looks like somebody's beginning to take an interest in your handiwork.`,
  `Looks like we're coming up on Alderaan.`,
  `Looks like you managed to cut off our only escape route.`,
  `Loosen up!`,
  `Lord Vader, I should have known. Only you could be so bold. The Imperial Senate will not sit still for this, when they hear you've attacked a diplomatic...`,
  `Lord Vader, the battle station plans are not aboard this ship! And no transmissions were made.`,
  `An escape pod was jettisoned during the fighting, but no life forms were aboard.`,
  `Lost Tiree, lost Dutch.`,
  `Luke!`,
  `Luke! I don't believe it! How'd you get here... are you going out with us?!`,
  `Luke! Luke!`,
  `Luke! Luke! Luke!`,
  `Luke! Luke! Luke!`,
  `Luke, at that speed will you be able to pull out in time?`,
  `Luke, I didn't come back just to say goodbye... I shouldn't tell you this, but you're the only one I can trust... and if I don't come back, I want somebody to know.`,
  `Luke, I'm shutting the power down for the night.`,
  `Luke, let me know when you're going in.`,
  `Luke, Luke, grab a hold of this.`,
  `Luke, pull up!`,
  `Luke, take these two over to the garage, will you? I want you to have both of them cleaned up before dinner.`,
  `Luke, tell Owen that if he gets a translator to be sure it speaks Bocce.`,
  `Luke, the Force will be with you.`,
  `Luke, trust me.`,
  `Luke? Luke! Come to dinner!`,
  `Luke? Luke? Luke? Where could he be loafing now!`,
  `Luke's just not a farmer, Owen. He has too much of his father in him.`,
  `Man your ships! And may the Force be with you!`,
  `Marching into the detention area is not what I had in mind.`,
  `Master Luke here is your rightful owner. We'll have no more of this Obi-Wan Kenobi jibberish...`,
  `and don't talk to me of your mission, either.`,
  `You're fortunate he doesn't blast you into a million pieces right here.`,
  `Master Luke, sir! Pardon me for asking... but, ah... what should Artoo and I do if we're discovered here?`,
  `Maybe it's another drill.`,
  `Maybe someday... I'll keep a lookout.`,
  `Maybe they know what happened.`,
  `Mos Eisley Spaceport. You will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy. We must be cautious.`,
  `Move along. Move along.`,
  `My friend has a friend on Bestine who might help us make contact.`,
  `My scope shows the tower, but I can't see the exhaust port! Are you sure the computer can hit it?`,
  `My scope's negative. I don't see anything.`,
  `Negative! It didn't go in, it just impacted on the surface.`,
  `Negative.`,
  `Negola dewaghi wooldugger?!?`,
  `Nice! Come on!`,
  `Ninety-four.`,
  `No blasters! No blaster!`,
  `No more adventures. I'm not going that way.`,
  `No reward is worth this.`,
  `No sign of any... wait!`,
  `No!`,
  `No!`,
  `No!`,
  `No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no weapons. You can't possibly...`,
  `No! wait!`,
  `No, he's not going to try anything.`,
  `No, I don't like you either.`,
  `No, I don't think he likes you at all.`,
  `No, I'm leaving in the morning...`,
  `No, my father didn't fight in the wars. He was a navigator on a spice freighter.`,
  `No, sir. If there were any on board, they must also have jettisoned.`,
  `No, wait. They'll hear!`,
  `No, you're not. What kind of talk is that?`,
  `No. It's a short range fighter.`,
  `Not a bad bit of rescuing, huh? You know, sometimes I even amaze myself.`,
  `Not after we demonstrate the power of this station.`,
  `In a way, you have determined the choice of the planet that'll be destroyed first.`,
  `Since you are reluctant to provide us with the location of the Rebel base, I have chosen to test this station's destructive power... on your home planet of Alderaan.`,
  `Not again! Forget it.`,
  `Not for long...`,
  `Not if I can help it. Chewie... jam it's transmissions.`,
  `Not likely! I had to cancel my application. There has been a lot of unrest among the Sand People since you left...`,
  `they've even raided the outskirts of Anchorhead.`,
  `Not on your life! That little droid and I have been through a lot together. You okay, Artoo?`,
  `Not this ship, sister.`,
  `Nothing. I'm all right.`,
  `Now be careful, Artoo.`,
  `Now let's blow this thing and go home!`,
  `Now, let's see if we can't figure out what you are, my little friend. And where you come from.`,
  `Now, look, don't get any funny ideas. The old man wants us to wait right here.`,
  `Now's our chance! Go!`,
  `Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him.`,
  `Obi-Wan Kenobi! What makes you think so?`,
  `Obi-Wan Kenobi... Obi-Wan? Now thats a name I haven't heard in a long time... a long time.`,
  `Obi-Wan Kenobi? I wonder if he means old Ben Kenobi?`,
  `Of course I can, sir. It's like a second language for me... I'm as fluent in Bocce...`,
  `Of course I got it. Signed aboard The Rand Ecliptic last week. First mate Biggs Darklighter at your service... I just came back to say goodbye to all you unfortunate landlocked simpletons.`,
  `Oh my... sir, he says there are several creatures approaching from the southeast.`,
  `Oh! All this excitement has overrun the circuits of my counterpart here. If you don't mind, I'd like to take him down to maintenance.`,
  `Oh, he excels at that, sir.`,
  `Oh, he says it's nothing, sir. Merely a malfunction. Old data. Pay it no mind.`,
  `Oh, he's not dead, no... not yet.`,
  `Oh, I think I just blasted it.`,
  `Oh, it's Han! I don't know, I really thought he'd change his mind. `,
  `Oh, it's nothing. Don't worry about it.`,
  `Oh, my! Artoo! Can you hear me? Say something! You can repair him, can't you?`,
  `Oh, my. I'd forgotten how much I hate space travel.`,
  `Oh, no!`,
  `Oh, no!`,
  `Oh, no!`,
  `Oh, no! We've got to do something.`,
  `Oh, this little droid! I think he's searching for his former master ... I've never seen such devotion in a droid before...`,
  `there seems to be no stopping him. He claims to be the property of an Obi-Wan Kenobi. Is he a relative of yours?`,
  `Do you know who he's talking about?`,
  `Okay, easy she goes!`,
  `Okay, let's go.`,
  `Okay. Han, you put these on.`,
  `Okay. Now, I'm going to put these on you.`,
  `Okay. You guys got yourself a ship. We'll leave as soon as you're ready. Docking bay Ninety-four.`,
  `Old Ben Kenobi lives out in this direction somewhere, but I don't see how that R2 unit could have come this far.`,
  `We must have missed him. Uncle Owen isn't going to take this very well.`,
  `One thing's for sure. We're all going to be a lot thinner! Get on top of it!`,
  `Only a master of evil, Darth.`,
  `Only a precise hit will set up a chain reaction. The shaft is ray- shielded, so you'll have to use proton torpedoes.`,
  `Only passengers. Myself, the boy, two droids, and no questions asked.`,
  `Oooh!`,
  `Open the blast doors! Open the blast doors!`,
  `Orbiting the planet at maximum velocity. The moon with the Rebel base will be in range in thirty minutes.`,
  `Our position is correct, except... no, Alderaan!`,
  `Our scout ships have reached Dantooine. They found the remains of a Rebel base, but they estimate that it has been deserted for some time.`,
  `They are now conducting an extensive search of the surrounding systems.`,
  `Over here! Help! Please, help!`,
  `Over my dead body.`,
  `Owen, he can't stay here forever. Most of his friends have gone. It means so much to him.`,
  `Pardon me for asking, sir, but what good are snub fighters going to be against that?`,
  `Pardon me, sir, but couldn't we go after him?`,
  `Partially. But it also obeys your commands.`,
  `Perhaps she would respond to an alternative form of persuasion.`,
  `PILOT There goes another one.`,
  `Plug in. He should be able to interpret the entire Imperial computer network.`,
  `Princess Leia, before your execution I would like you to be my guest at a ceremony that will make this battle station operational.`,
  `No star system will dare oppose the Emperor now.`,
  `Princess Leia.`,
  `Princess?`,
  `Princess? What's going on?`,
  `Prisoner transfer from Block one- one-three-eight.`,
  `Pull in! Luke... pull in!`,
  `Pursued by the Empire's sinister agents, Princess Leia races home aboard her starship, custodian of the stolen plans that can save her people and restore freedom to the galaxy...`,
  `Put that thing away! You're going to get us all killed.`,
  `Quick, we've got to get across. Find the control that extends the bridge.`,
  `Quickly, son... they're on the move.`,
  `Quiet down will ya! You got a mouth bigger than a meteor crater!`,
  `Rebel base, in range.`,
  `Rebel base, one minute and closing.`,
  `Rebel base, thirty seconds and closing.`,
  `Rebel base, three minutes and closing.`,
  `Red Eleven standing by.`,
  `Red Five standing by.`,
  `Red Five, can you see them from where you are?`,
  `Red Group, this is Red Leader.`,
  `Red Leader, this is Base One. Keep half your group out of range for the next run.`,
  `Red Leader, this is Gold Leader.`,
  `Red Leader, we're right above you. Turn to point...`,
  `Red Leader...`,
  `Red Nine standing by.`,
  `Red Seven standing by.`,
  `Red Six standing by.`,
  `Red Six...`,
  `Red Ten standing by.`,
  `Red Three standing by.`,
  `Red Three, standing by.`,
  `Red Two standing by.`,
  `Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him.`,
  `Remember, the Force will be with you... always.`,
  `Rendezvous at mark six point one.`,
  `Rest easy, son, you've had a busy day. You're fortunate you're still in one piece.`,
  `Rich?`,
  `Right with you, boss.`,
  `Run, Luke! Run!`,
  `'S VOICE Hey down there, could you give us a hand with this?`,
  `Sand People! Or worse! Come on, let's have a look. Come on.`,
  `Secret mission? What plans? What are you talking about? I'm not getting in there!`,
  `Secure this area until the alert is canceled.`,
  `Seems okay, if we can get to it. Just hope the old man got the tractor beam out of commission.`,
  `See-Threepio! See-Threepio!`,
  `See-Threepio, do you copy?`,
  `Send a scanning crew on board. I want every part of this ship checked.`,
  `Seventeen thousand! Those guys must really be desperate. This could really save my neck.`,
  `Get back to the ship and get her ready.`,
  `Seventeen, huh!`,
  `Several fighters have broken off from the main group. Come with me!`,
  `Several, I think. Actually, there's not much to tell. I'm not much more than an interpreter, and not very good at telling stories.`,
  `Well, not at making them interesting, anyways.`,
  `Shape it up you guys!... Biggs?`,
  `She lied! She lied to us!`,
  `She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod. Send a detachment down to retrieve them. See to it personally, Commander.`,
  `There'll be no one to stop us this time.`,
  `She'll be all right. Inform Lord Vader we have a prisoner.`,
  `She'll die before shell tell you anything.`,
  `She'll make point five beyond the speed of light. She may not look like much, but she's got it where it counts, kid.`,
  `I've added some special modifications myself.`,
  `She's rich.`,
  `Should I have?`,
  `Shut down all the garbage mashers on the detention level.`,
  `Shutting up, sir.`,
  `Sir, if you'll not be needing me, I'll close down for awhile.`,
  `Sir, Luke is the best bushpilot in the outer rim territories.`,
  `Sir, would it help if you told him it was my fault.`,
  `So long, Luke.`,
  `So... what do you think of her, Han?`,
  `So... you got your reward and you're just leaving then?`,
  `Somebody has to save our skins. Into the garbage chute, wise guy.`,
  `Someone was in the pod. The tracks go off in this direction. `,
  `Something just moves past my leg! Look! Did you see that?`,
  `Sorry about the mess.`,
  `Sorry!`,
  `Squad leaders, we've picked up a new group of signals. Enemy fighters coming your way.`,
  `Stabilize your rear deflectors. Watch for enemy fighters.`,
  `Stand by to fire at Rebel base.`,
  `Stand by, Chewie, here we go. Cut in the sublight engines.`,
  `Stand-by alert. Death Star approaching. Estimated time to firing range, fifteen minutes.`,
  `Standing by.`,
  `Stay in attack formation!`,
  `Stay on target!`,
  `Stay on target.`,
  `Stay sharp! There are two more coming in; they're going to try to cut us off.`,
  `Stay there...`,
  `Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I don't know, what do you think?`,
  `Do you think a princess and a guy like me...`,
  `Stop that ship!`,
  `Stretch out with your feelings.`,
  `Sure, go ahead.`,
  `Sure, there're more than enough droids.`,
  `Surely he must be dead by now.`,
  `Switch power to front deflection screens.`,
  `Switch to targeting computer.`,
  `Switch your deflectors on.`,
  `Take over! See to him! Look there!`,
  `Take over. We've got a bad transmitter. I'll see what I can do.`,
  `Target's coming up!`,
  `Ten thousand? We could almost buy our own ship for that!`,
  `Terminate her... immediately!`,
  `Thank the maker! This oil bath is going to feel so good. I've got such a bad case of dust contamination, I can barely move!`,
  `Thank you, sir. I'll try.`,
  `Thanks, Wedge.`,
  `That doesn't sound too hard. Besides, they let us go. It's the only explanation for the ease of our escape.`,
  `That isn't very reassuring.`,
  `That malfunctioning little twerp. This is all his fault! He tricked me into going this way, but he'll do no better.`,
  `That old man's just a crazy wizard. Tomorrow I want you to take that R2 unit into Anchorhead and have its memory flushed.`,
  `That'll be the end of it. It belongs to us now.`,
  `That oughta hold it for a while.`,
  `That R2 unit has always been a problem. These astro-droids are getting quite out of hand. Even I can't understand their logic at times. `,
  `That's 'cause droids don't pull people's arms out of their socket when they lose. Wookiees are known to do that.`,
  `That's funny, the damage doesn't look as bad from out here.`,
  `That's good. You have taken your first step into a larger world.`,
  `That's how we came to be in your service, if you take my meaning, sir.`,
  `That's impossible! How will the Emperor maintain control without the bureaucracy?`,
  `That's impossible, even for a computer.`,
  `That's no battle, hot shot... they're just sitting there! Probably a freighter-tanker refueling.`,
  `That's no moon! It's a space station.`,
  `That's okay. I'm never coming back to this planet again.`,
  `That's right, yeah! I got some old debts I've got to pay off with this stuff.`,
  `Even if I didn't, you don't think I'd be fool enough to stick around here, do you? Why don't you come with us?`,
  `You're pretty good in a fight. I could use you.`,
  `That's the idea I've been looking forward to killing you for a long time.`,
  `That's what I'm afraid of.`,
  `Thats what I'm trying to tell you, kid. It ain't there. It's been totally blown away.`,
  `That's what your uncle told you. He didn't hold with your father's ideals. Thought he should have stayed here and not gotten involved.`,
  `That's your imagination.`,
  `That's your uncle talking.`,
  `The Academy didn't change you much... but you're back so soon? Hey, what happened, didn't you get your commission?`,
  `The approach will not be easy. You are required to maneuver straight down this trench and skim the surface to this point.`,
  `The target area is only two meters wide. It's a small thermal exhaust port, right below the main port. The shaft leads directly to the reactor system.`,
  `A precise hit will start a chain reaction which should destroy the station.`,
  `The battle station is heavily shielded and carries a firepower greater than half the star fleet.`,
  `Its defenses are designed around a direct large-scale assault. A small one-man fighter should be able to penetrate the outer defense.`,
  `The Death Star has cleared the planet. The Death Star has cleared the planet.`,
  `The Death Star plans are not in the main computer.`,
  `The droid belongs to her. She's the one in the message. We've got to help her.`,
  `The entire starfleet couldn't destroy the whole planet. It'd take a thousand ships with more fire power than I've...`,
  `The exhaust post is...`,
  `The final check-out is complete. All systems are operational. What course shall we set?`,
  `The Force can have a strong influence on the weak-minded. You will find it a powerful ally.`,
  `The Force is strong with this one!`,
  `The Force?`,
  `The guns... they've stopped!`,
  `The Imperial Senate will no longer be of any concern to us. I've just received word that the Emperor has dissolved the council permanently.`,
  `The last remnants of the Old Republic have been swept away.`,
  `The Jedi are extinct, their fire has gone out of the universe. You, my friend, are all that's left of their religion.`,
  `The Jundland Wastes are not to be traveled lightly. Tell me, young Luke, what brings you out this far?`,
  `The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers.`,
  `The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands.`,
  `The princess! Put all sections on alert!`,
  `The princess? She's here?`,
  `The Rebellion will continue to gain support in the Imperial Senate as long as....`,
  `The regional governors now have direct control over territories. Fear will keep the local systems in line. Fear of this battle station.`,
  `The ship's all yours. If the scanners pick up anything, report it immediately. All right, let's go.`,
  `The technical readouts of that battle station. I only hope that when the data is analyzed, a weakness can be found. It's not over yet!`,
  `The tractor beam is coupled to the main reactor in seven locations. A power loss at one of the terminals will allow the ship to leave.`,
  `The walls are moving!`,
  `Their tracking us!`,
  `Then he must have gotten lost, been part of a convoy or something...`,
  `Then I guess I won't see you.`,
  `Then the droid does belong to you.`,
  `There are still two more of them out there!`,
  `There are two Banthas down there but I don't see any... wait a second, they're Sand People all right. I can see one of them now.`,
  `There aren't any bases around here. Where did it come from?`,
  `There isn't any other way out.`,
  `There she is! Set for stun!`,
  `There they are!`,
  `There wasn't anything you could have done.`,
  `There you go.`,
  `There. You see Lord Vader, she can be reasonable. Continue with the operation. You may fire when ready.`,
  `There'll be no escape for the Princess this time.`,
  `There's a heavy fire zone on this side. Red Five, where are you?`,
  `There's another ship coming in.`,
  `There's no lock!`,
  `There's nothin' I can do about it, kid. I'm in full power. I'm going to have to shut down.`,
  `But they're not going to get me without a fight!`,
  `There's nothing you could have done, Luke, had you been there. You'd have been killed, too, and the droids would now be in the hands of the Empire.`,
  `There's something alive in here!`,
  `There's too much interference!`,
  `These are not the droids we're looking for.`,
  `These are not the droids youre looking for.`,
  `These are the same Jawas that sold us Artoo and Threepio.`,
  `They aren't here! Something must have happened to them. See if they've been captured.`,
  `They came from behind....`,
  `They didn't. But we are meant to think they did. These tracks are side by side. Sand People always ride single file to hide there numbers.`,
  `They have just made the jump into hyperspace.`,
  `They must be delivered safely or other star systems will suffer the same fate as Alderaan. Your destiny lies along a different path from mine.`,
  `The Force will be with you ... always!`,
  `They must be trying to return the stolen plans to the princess. She may yet be of some use to us.`,
  `They're coming in too fast!`,
  `They're coming through!`,
  `They're for sale if you want them.`,
  `They're going to execute her. Look, a few minutes ago you said you didn't want to just wait here to be captured. Now all you want to do is stay. `,
  `They're heading in this direction. What are we going to do? We'll be sent to the spice mines of Kessel or smashed into who knows what!`,
  `They're madmen! They're heading for the prison level. If you hurry, you might catch them.`,
  `They're on Dantooine.`,
  `They've coming in! Three marks at two ten.`,
  `Things always change.`,
  `This bickering is pointless. Lord Vader will provide us with the location of the Rebel fortress by the time this station is operational.`,
  `We will then crush the Rebellion with one swift stroke.`,
  `This is Chewbacca. He's first- mate on a ship that might suit our needs.`,
  `This is it!`,
  `This is not going to work.`,
  `This is Red Five! I'm going in!`,
  `This is Red Two. Flying towards you.`,
  `This is some rescue. When you came in here, didn't you have a plan for getting out?`,
  `This little one isn't worth the effort. Come let me buy you something...`,
  `This R2 unit has a bad motivator. Look!`,
  `This R2 unit of your seems a bit beat up. Do you want a new one?`,
  `This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct.`,
  `This will be a day long remembered. It has seen the end of Kenobi and it will soon see the end of the Rebellion.`,
  `Threepio!`,
  `Threepio! Come in Threepio! Threepio! Where could he be?`,
  `Threepio! Come in, Threepio! Threepio!`,
  `To your stations!`,
  `Traveling through hyperspace isn't like dusting crops, boy!`,
  `Without precise calculations we could fly right through a star or bounce too close to a supernova and that'd end your trip real quick, wouldn't it?`,
  `Turn the ship around!`,
  `TX-four-one-two. Why aren't you at your post? TX-four-one-two, do you copy? `,
  `Uh, I'm quite sure you'll be very pleased with that one, sir. He really is in first-class condition.`,
  `I've worked with him before. Here he comes.`,
  `Uh, uh, negative, negative. We had a reactor leak here now. Give us a few minutes to lock it down. Large leak... very dangerous.`,
  `Uh, you can call me Luke.`,
  `Uh... Threepio, hand me those binders there will you?`,
  `Uh? Did he take those two new droids with him?`,
  `Uncle Owen! Aunt Beru! Uncle Owen!`,
  `Uncle Owen...`,
  `Uncle Owen...`,
  `Unlock one-five-seven and nine. Release charges.`,
  `Until this battle station is fully operational we are vulnerable. The Rebel Alliance is too well equipped. They're more dangerous than you realize.`,
  `Use the comlink? Oh, my! I forgot I turned it off!`,
  `Use the Force, Luke.`,
  `Vaporators! Sir - My first job was programming binary load lifters ... very similar to your vaporators. You could say...`,
  `VOICE Open up in there!`,
  `Wait a minute!`,
  `Wait a minute, where are you going?`,
  `Wait!`,
  `Wait, Luke! It's too dangerous.`,
  `Wait, there's something dead ahead on the scanner. It looks like our droid... hit the accelerator.`,
  `Wait, what's that? A transport! I'm saved!`,
  `Wake up! Wake up!`,
  `Watch your back! Fighter's above you, coming in!`,
  `Watch your back, Luke!`,
  `Watch your mouth, kid, or you're going to find yourself floating home. We'll be safe enough once we make the jump to hyperspace.`,
  `Besides, I know a few maneuvers. We'll lose them!`,
  `Watch yourself! Increase speed full throttle!`,
  `Watch yourself! There's a lot of fire coming from the right side of that deflection tower.`,
  `We are approaching the planet Yavin. The Rebel base is on a moon on the far side. We are preparing to orbit the planet.`,
  `We count thirty Rebel ships, Lord Vader. But they're so small they're evading our turbo-lasers!`,
  `We did it!`,
  `We don't have time for our sorrows, commander. The battle station has surely tracked us here.`,
  `It's the only explanation for the ease of our escape. You must use the information in this R2 unit to plan the attack. It is our only hope.`,
  `We don't need to see his identification.`,
  `We don't serve their kind here!`,
  `We found the computer outlet, sir.`,
  `We haven't that much with us. But we could pay you two thousand now, plus fifteen when we reach Alderaan.`,
  `We intercepted no transmissions. Aaah... This is a consular ship. Were on a diplomatic mission.`,
  `We ran into some old friends.`,
  `We should be able to see it by now.`,
  `We'll get to work on him right away.`,
  `We'll have to destroy them ship to ship. Get the crews to their fighters.`,
  `Well more wealth that you can imagine.`,
  `Well of course, of course I know him. He's me! I haven't gone by the name Obi-Wan since oh, before you were born.`,
  `We'll stay back far enough to cover you.`,
  `Well, anything would be better than just hanging around waiting for them to pick us up...`,
  `Well, come on. It's getting late. I only hope we can get back before Uncle Owen really blows up.`,
  `Well, he ain't going to be around long enough to tell anyone about us.`,
  `Well, he'd better have those units in the south range repaired be midday or there'll be hell to pay!`,
  `Well, I didn't...`,
  `Well, I don't know anyone named Obi-Wan, but old Ben lives out beyond the dune sea. He's kind of a strange old hermit.`,
  `Well, I stumbled across a recording while I was cleaning him. He says he belongs to someone called Obi- Wan Kenobi.`,
  `Well, I wasn't gonna let you get all the credit and take all the reward.`,
  `Well, if there's a bright center to the universe, you're on the planet that it's farthest from.`,
  `Well, I'll be at the Academy next season... after that who knows. I won't be drafted into the Imperial Starfleet that's for sure...`,
  `Take care of yourself, you'll always be the best friend I've got.`,
  `Well, I'm not going that way. It's much too rocky. This way is much easier.`,
  `Well, let's get moving!`,
  `Well, most of the best freighter pilots can be found here. Only watch your step. This place can be a little rough.`,
  `Well, my little friend, you've got something jammed in here real good. Were you on a starcruiser or...`,
  `Well, not unless you can alter time, speed up the harvest, or teleport me off this rock!`,
  `Well, see what you can do with him. I'll be right back.`,
  `Well, that's the real trick, isn't it? And it's going to cost you something extra. Ten thousand in advance.`,
  `Well, the Empire doesn't consider a small one-man fighter to be any threat, or they'd have a tighter defense.`,
  `An analysis of the plans provided by Princess Leia has demonstrated a weakness in the battle station.`,
  `Well, the Force is what gives the Jedi his power. It's an energy field created by all living things.`,
  `It surrounds us and penetrates us. It binds the galaxy together.`,
  `Well, things haven't been the same since you left, Biggs. It's been so...quiet.`,
  `Well, wait a minute. Where'd she go? Bring her back! Play back the entire message.`,
  `Well, who... who has he found?`,
  `Well, you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs. I told you I'd outrun 'em.`,
  `We're a little rushed, so if you'll hurry aboard we'll get out of here.`,
  `We're all right. You did great.`,
  `We're caught in a tractor beam! It's pulling us in!`,
  `We're doomed!`,
  `We're doomed.`,
  `We're in position. I'm going to cut across the axis and try and draw their fire.`,
  `We're losing our deflector shield. Go strap yourself in, I'm going to make the jump to light speed.`,
  `We're passing through their magnetic field.`,
  `We're right above you. Stand by.`,
  `We're sending a squad up.`,
  `We're starting for the target shaft now.`,
  `We're too close.`,
  `We've analyzed their attack, sir, and there is a danger. Should I have your ship standing by?`,
  `We've been cut off! Are there any other ways out of the cell bay?... What was that? I didn't copy!`,
  `We've captured a freighter entering the remains of the Alderaan system.`,
  `It's markings match those of a ship that blasted its way out of Mos Eisley.`,
  `We've entered the Alderaan system.`,
  `We've got to find out which cell this princess of yours is in. Here it is... cell twenty-one- eight-seven.`,
  `You go get her. I'll hold them here.`,
  `We've had some problems...`,
  `We've lost lateral controls.`,
  `What a desolate place this is.`,
  `What a piece of junk.`,
  `What about that one?`,
  `What about that tower?`,
  `What are you doing hiding there?`,
  `What are you talking about?`,
  `What are you talking about?`,
  `What do you mean?`,
  `What do you mean? Where is it?`,
  `What good will it do us if he gets himself killed? Come on!`,
  `What good's a reward if you ain't around to use it?`,
  `Besides, attacking that battle station ain't my idea of courage. It's more like suicide.`,
  `What happened?`,
  `What happened?`,
  `What happened?`,
  `What I really need is a droid that understands the binary languages of moisture vaporators.`,
  `What is it?`,
  `What is it?`,
  `What is it? Some kind of local trouble?`,
  `What is what?!? He asked you a question... What is that?`,
  `What kept you?`,
  `What makes you think that?`,
  `What makes you think there are settlements over there?`,
  `What message? The one youve just been playing. The one you're carrying inside your rusty innards! `,
  `What mission? What are you talking about? I've had just about enough of you! Go that way!`,
  `You'll be malfunctioning within a day, you nearsighted scrap pile!`,
  `What the hell are you doing?`,
  `What the...? Aw, we've come out of hyperspace into a meteor shower.`,
  `Some kind of asteroid collision. It's not on any of the charts.`,
  `What was that?`,
  `What?`,
  `What?`,
  `What?`,
  `What?`,
  `What?`,
  `What? How?`,
  `What? Oh... the uniform. I'm Luke Skywalker. I'm here to rescue you. `,
  `Whatever you say. I've done more than I bargained for on this trip already.`,
  `What're you lookin' at? I know what I'm doing.`,
  `What's going on?`,
  `What's so important? What's he carrying?`,
  `What's that flashing?`,
  `What's that?`,
  `What's this?`,
  `What's wrong with him now?`,
  `What's wrong?`,
  `What's your plan?`,
  `When I left you, I was but the learner; now I am the master.`,
  `When we heard about Alderaan, we were afraid that you were... lost along with your father.`,
  `Where am I? I must have taken a bad step...`,
  `Where are those transmissions you intercepted?`,
  `Where are you going?`,
  `Where are you going?`,
  `Where are you going? Come back!`,
  `Where are you taking this... thing?`,
  `Where could he be? Threepio! Threepio, will you come in?`,
  `Where could they be?`,
  `Where did you dig up that old fossil?`,
  `Where... where is she?`,
  `Where?`,
  `Which way?`,
  `Who do you think...`,
  `Who is she? She's beautiful.`,
  `Who is this? What's your operating number?`,
  `Who's the more foolish... the fool or the fool who follows him?`,
  `Why are we still moving towards it?`,
  `Why didn't you say so before?`,
  `Why don't you outrun them? I thought you said this thing was fast.`,
  `Why would Imperial troops want to slaughter Jawas?`,
  `Will you forget it? I already tried it. It's magnetically sealed!`,
  `With all we've been through, sometimes I'm amazed we're in as good condition as we are, what with the Rebellion and all.`,
  `With pleasure.`,
  `Wonderful girl! Either I'm going to kill her or I'm beginning to like her. Get in there!`,
  `Yeah, but this time I got the money.`,
  `Yeah, great at getting us into trouble.`,
  `Yeah, I think your right. Full reverse! Chewie, lock in the auxiliary power.`,
  `Yeah, take it away.`,
  `Yeah, that's what you said last year when Biggs and Tank left.`,
  `Yeah?`,
  `Yeah?`,
  `Yes, Greedo. As a matter of fact, I was just going to see your boss. Tell Jabba that I've got his money.`,
  `Yes, I was once a Jedi Knight the same as your father.`,
  `Yes, I'll bet you have.`,
  `Yes, indeed. If it's a fast ship.`,
  `Yes, sir.`,
  `Yes, sir.`,
  `Yes, sir.`,
  `Yes, sir. I think those new droids are going to work out fine.`,
  `In fact, I, uh, was also thinking about our agreement about my staying on another season.`,
  `And if these new droids do work out, I want to transmit my application to the Academy this year.`,
  `Yes.`,
  `Yes.`,
  `Yes.`,
  `Yes.`,
  `Yes. Rich, powerful! Listen, if you were to rescue her, the reward would be...`,
  `You bet I could. I'm not such a bad pilot myself! We don't have to sit here and listen...`,
  `You came in that thing? You're braver that I thought.`,
  `You can go about your business.`,
  `You can tell that to Jabba. He may only take your ship.`,
  `You can waste time with your friends when your chores are done. Now, come on, get to it!`,
  `You can't do any more good back there!`,
  `You can't win, Darth. If you strike me down, I shall become more powerful than you can possibly imagine.`,
  `You can't win. But there are alternatives to fighting.`,
  `You did, all right. It's going to be like old times Luke. We're a couple of shooting stars that'll never be stopped!`,
  `You don't believe in the Force, do you?`,
  `You don't need to see his identification.`,
  `You fought in the Clone Wars?`,
  `You got a lot of carbon scoring here. It looks like you boys have seen a lot of action.`,
  `You know him!`,
  `You know of the Rebellion against the Empire?`,
  `You know that little droid is going to cause me a lot of trouble.`,
  `You know, between his howling and your blasting everything in sight, it's a wonder the whole station doesn't know we're here.`,
  `You know, even I get boarded sometimes, Jabba.`,
  `I had no choice, but I've got a charter now and I can pay you back, plus a little extra. I just need some more time.`,
  `You know, I did feel something. I could almost see the remote.`,
  `You know, I think that R2 unit we bought might have been stolen.`,
  `You may fire when ready.`,
  `You mean it controls your actions?`,
  `You mean the next semester before harvest?`,
  `You must do what you feel is right, of course.`,
  `You must learn the ways of the Force if you're to come with me to Alderaan.`,
  `You must repair him! Sir, if any of my circuits or gears will help, I'll gladly donate them.`,
  `You must understand I need you here, Luke.`,
  `You needn't worry about your reward. If money is all that you love, then that's what you'll receive!`,
  `You ought to take it a little easy Luke. You may be the hottest bushpilot this side of Mos Eisley, but those little Skyhoppers are dangerous.`,
  `Keep it up, and one day, whammo, you're going to be nothing more than a dark spot on the down side of a canyon wall.`,
  `You see, you can do it.`,
  `You sent Greedo to blast me.`,
  `You watch your language!`,
  `You will...`,
  `You worry about those fighters! I'll worry about the tower!`,
  `You would prefer another target? A military target? Then name the system!`,
  `You wouldn't want my life to get boring, would you?`,
  `You'd better get on with your exercises.`,
  `You'd better let her loose.`,
  `You'll be dead.`,
  `You'll get it!`,
  `You'll have to sell your speeder.`,
  `Your droids. They'll have to wait outside. We don't want them here.`,
  `Your eyes can deceive you. Don't trust them.`,
  `Your fathers lightsaber. This is the weapon of a Jedi Knight. Not as clumsy or as random as a blaster. `,
  `Your friend is quite a mercenary. I wonder if he really cares about anything... or anyone.`,
  `Your powers are weak, old man.`,
  `Your uncle could hold off a whole colony of Sand People with one blaster.`,
  `You're a part of the Rebel Alliance ... and a traitor. Take her away!`,
  `Youre crazy! You could wander around forever trying to find them.`,
  `You're far too trusting. Dantooine is too remote to make an effective demonstration. But don't worry.`,
  `We will deal with your Rebel friends soon enough. `,
  `You're safe! We had feared the worst.`,
  `You're sure the homing beacon is secure aboard their ship? I'm taking an awful risk, Vader. This had better work.`,
  `You're who?`,
