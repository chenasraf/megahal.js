  'I think, Watson, that you have put on seven and a half pounds since I saw you.',
  'Indeed, I should have thought a little more. Just a trifle more, I fancy, Watson. And in practice again, I observe.',
  'I see it, I deduce it.',
  'It is simplicity itself.',
  'Quite so.',
  'You see, but you do not observe. The distinction is clear.',
  'How often?',
  'Quite so! You have not observed. And yet you have seen. That is just my point.',
  'I have no data yet. It is a capital mistake to theorize before one has data. Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories, instead of theories to suit facts.',
  'Peculiar--that is the very word.',
  'What do you make of that?',
  "There's money in this case, Watson, if there is nothing else.",
  'This promises to be interesting. It would be a pity to miss it.',
  'I was aware of it.',
  'I was also aware of that.',
  'Then, pray consult.',
  'Let me see!',
  'You have compromised yourself seriously.',
  'So I have heard.',
  'And why?',
  'That is very fortunate, as I have one or two matters of importance to look into just at present.',
  'Then I shall drop you a line to let you know how we progress.',
  "If you will be good enough to call to-morrow afternoon at three o'clock I should like to chat this little matter over with you.",
  "It's quite too funny. I am sure you could never guess how I employed my morning, or what I ended by doing.",
  'This was quite too good to lose, Watson.',
  'This is a very unexpected turn of affairs.',
  'I have been too busy to think of food, and I am likely to be busier still this evening.',
  'By the way, Doctor, I shall want your co-operation.',
  "You don't mind breaking the law?",
  'Oh, the cause is excellent!',
  'I was sure that I might rely on you.',
  'There is only one point on which I must insist. You must not interfere, come what may. You understand?',
  'That is excellent. I think, perhaps, it is almost time that I prepare for the new role I have to play.',
  'Now the question is, where are we to find the photograph?',
  'Pshaw! They did not know how to look.',
  'I will not look.',
  'I know where it is.',
  'I do not wish to make a mystery. The matter was perfectly simple.',
  "I've heard that voice before. Now, I wonder who the deuce that could have been.",
  'I am Mr. Holmes.',
  'You could not possibly have come at a better time, my dear Watson.',
  'So I am. Very much so.',
  'I know, my dear Watson, that you share my love of all that is bizarre and outside the conventions and humdrum routine of everyday life.',
  'You did, Doctor, but none the less you must come round to my view, for otherwise I shall keep on piling fact upon fact on you until your reason breaks down under them and acknowledges me to be right.',
  'Your experience has been a most entertaining one.',
  'Pray continue your very interesting statement.',
  "I really wouldn't miss your case for the world. It is most refreshingly unusual. But there is, if you will excuse my saying so, something just a little funny about it.",
  'And what did you do then?',
  'Your case is an exceedingly remarkable one, and I shall be happy to look into it.',
  'From what you have told me I think that it is possible that graver issues hang from it than might at first sight appear.',
  'I shall be happy to give you an opinion upon the subject in the course of a day or two.',
  'As a rule, the more bizarre a thing is the less mysterious it proves to be. It is your commonplace, featureless crimes which are really puzzling, just as a commonplace face is the most difficult to identify.',
  "It is quite a three pipe problem, and I beg that you won't speak to me for fifty minutes.",
  'My dear doctor, this is a time for observation, not for talk.',
  'I must really ask you to be a little more quiet!',
  'We have at least an hour before us.',
  'And now it is time that we arranged our little plans. I expect that within an hour matters will come to a head.',
  'I have an inspector and two officers waiting at the front door.',
  'My dear fellow, life is infinitely stranger than anything which the mind of man could invent.',
  'We would not dare to conceive the things which are really mere commonplaces of existence.',
  'If we could fly out of that window hand in hand, hover over this great city, gently remove the roofs, and peep in at the queer things which are going on, the strange coincidences, the plannings, the cross-purposes, the wonderful chains of events, working through generations, and leading to the most outr√© results, it would make all fiction with its conventionalities and foreseen conclusions most stale and unprofitable.',
  'A certain selection and discretion must be used in producing a realistic effect.',
  'I have seen those symptoms before.',
  'Perhaps I have trained myself to see what others overlook. If not, why should you come to consult me?',
  'You interest me extremely.',
  'You have made your position very clear to me.',
  'It has long been an axiom of mine that the little things are infinitely the most important.',
  'It seems to me that you have been very shamefully treated.',
  'But you have no notion as to what it could have been?',
  'One more question. How did your mother take the matter?',
  'And your father? Did you tell him?',
  'I fear not.',
  'You will leave that question in my hands.',
  'Thank you. You have made your statement very clearly.',
  'My dear fellow, is it possible you do not see how strongly it bears upon the case?',
  "There's a cold-blooded scoundrel!",
  'Have you heard anything of the case?',
  'But it is profoundly true. Singularity is almost invariably a clue. The more featureless and commonplace a crime is, the more difficult it is to bring it home.',
  'Well, it is conjectured to be so. I shall take nothing for granted until I have the opportunity of looking personally into it.',
  'I will explain the state of things to you, as far as I have been able to understand it, in a very few words.',
  'Circumstantial evidence is a very tricky thing.',
  'There is nothing more deceptive than an obvious fact.',
  'My dear fellow, I know you well.',
  'I think that it is very probable.',
  'In what way?',
  'Yes, certainly.',
  'You have been of material assistance to me.',
  'Indeed! That is interesting.',
  'You are right, you do find it very hard to tackle the facts.',
  'Oh, tut, tut! I have no time!',
  'It has been a case of considerable interest.',
  "I don't know quite what to do, and I should value your advice.",
  'Light a cigar and let me expound.',
  'It is obvious.',
  'Quite so.',
  'I am glad to hear you say so.',
  'It may not come to that.',
  'Well, it is not for me to judge you.',
  'I pray that we may never be exposed to such a temptation.',
  'God help us!',
  'Why does fate play such tricks with poor, helpless worms?',
  'I do not encourage visitors.',
  'That is easily got.',
  'That is not always so easy.',
  'He said too much.',
  'I have been beaten four times--three times by men, and once by a woman.',
  'It is true that I have been generally successful.',
  'None of those which come to me are. I am the last court of appeal.',
  'You fill me with interest.',
  'Pray give us the essential facts from the commencement, and I can afterwards question you as to those details which seem to me to be most important.',
  'Your statement is, I foresee, one of the most remarkable to which I have ever listened.',
  'Thank you. Pray proceed.',
  'What have you done?',
  'Nothing?',
  'You must act, man, or you are lost. Nothing but energy can save you. This is no time for despair.',
  'Ah!',
  'Why did you come to me, and, above all, why did you not come at once?',
  'And now you must on no account lose another instant. We cannot spare time even to discuss what you have told me. You must get home instantly and act.',
  'There is but one thing to do. It must be done at once.',
  'Do not lose an instant. And, above all, take care of yourself in the meanwhile, for I do not think that there can be a doubt that you are threatened by a very real and imminent danger.',
  'That is well. To-morrow I shall set to work upon your case.',
  'I think, Watson, that of all our cases we have had none more fantastic than this.',
  'There can be no question as to their nature.',
  'Excellent. We have already a clue.',
  'Does that suggest anything?',
  'More than that. It is probable.',
  'Ah! I feared as much. How was it done?',
  'That hurts my pride, Watson.',
  'It is a petty feeling, no doubt, but it hurts my pride.',
  'They must be cunning devils.',
  "So I am. But you've got mixed, Watson, for I have only been here a few hours, three pipes, four pipes--I forget how many. But I'll go home with you.",
  'Find what I owe, Watson. I am all off colour. I can do nothing for myself.',
  'I suppose, Watson, that you imagine that I have added opium-smoking to cocaine injections, and all the other little weaknesses on which you have favoured me with your medical views.',
  "Of course you are. You'll know all about it presently.",
  'You have a grand gift of silence, Watson. It makes you quite invaluable as a companion.',
  "'Pon my word, it is a great thing for me to have someone to talk to, for my own thoughts are not over-pleasant.",
  'Pray continue your narrative.',
  'It certainly sounds feasible.',
  'Because there are many inquiries which must be made out here.',
  'I have seen too much not to know that the impression of a woman may be more valuable than the conclusion of an analytical reasoner.',
  'Was the window open?',
  'A call for help, you thought?',
  'But it might have been a cry of surprise. Astonishment at the unexpected sight of you might cause him to throw up his hands?',
  'And you thought he was pulled back?',
  'You did not see anyone else in the room?',
  'Had he ever showed any signs of having taken opium?',
  'I want to test a little theory of mine.',
  'It has been in some points a singular case.',
  'I confess that I have been as blind as a mole, but it is better to learn wisdom late than never to learn it at all.',
  'I should like to see him very much.',
  "No, I think that I'll take it.",
  'No crime, but a very great error has been committed.',
  'I reached this one by sitting upon five pillows and consuming an ounce of shag.',
  'I think, Watson, that if we drive to Baker Street we shall just be in time for breakfast.',
  'Not at all. I am glad to have a friend with whom I can discuss my results.',
  'The matter is a perfectly trivial one, but there are points in connection with it which are not entirely devoid of interest and even of instruction.',
  'My dear fellow, there lies the problem.',
  'Only as much as we can deduce.',
  'Precisely.',
  'You know my methods.',
  'On the contrary, Watson, you can see everything. You fail, however, to reason from what you see. You are too timid in drawing your inferences.',
  'Not in the least. Is it possible that even now, when I give you these results, you are unable to see how they are attained?',
  'I cannot tell.',
  'By all means.',
  "Good-evening. It's a cold night.",
  "That's no good.",
  'What have you to say now?',
  'I think that I could be of assistance to you.',
  "My name is Sherlock Holmes. It is my business to know what other people don't know.",
  'Excuse me, I know everything of it.',
  'I am not retained by the police to supply their deficiencies.',
  "Very sorry to knock you up, Watson, but it's the common lot this morning. Mrs. Hudson has been knocked up, she retorted upon me, and I on you.",
  'My name is Sherlock Holmes.',
  'You must not fear. We shall soon set matters right, I have no doubt.',
  'Pray be precise as to details.',
  'Perfectly so.',
  'Quite so. Pray proceed with your statement.',
  'Very strange!',
  'Perhaps I have.',
  'I should prefer to have clearer proofs before I speak.',
  'No, I do not think so. I think that there was probably some more tangible cause.',
  'It is very kind of you.',
  'No, but I fancy that I may have deduced a little more. I imagine that you saw all that I did.',
  'Thank you. I am sorry to have interrupted you. Pray continue your most interesting statement.',
  'My dear Watson, you evidently did not realize my meaning when I said that this man may be taken as being quite on the same intellectual plane as myself.',
  'I think that I may go so far as to say, Watson, that I have not lived wholly in vain.',
  'In over a thousand cases I am not aware that I have ever used my powers upon the wrong side.',
  'Of late I have been tempted to look into the problems furnished by nature rather than those more superficial ones for which our artificial state of society is responsible.',
  'I think that you know me well enough, Watson, to understand that I am by no means a nervous man.',
  'You have probably never heard of Professor Moriarty?',
  'As you are aware, Watson, there is no one who knows the higher criminal world of London so well as I do.',
  'My dear Watson, Professor Moriarty is not a man who lets the grass grow under his feet.',
  'My dear Watson, you have not even condescended to say good-morning.',
  'Have you seen the morning paper, Watson?',
  'We must plan what we are to do about Moriarty now.',
  "Isn't it gorgeous! What do you think of it?",
  "No, it's not quite so bad as that.",
  'I confess that I am surprised and disappointed. I expected something definite by this time.',
  'You can do what you will, but I must remain on guard.',
  'I am very anxious that I should use the knowledge which I possess in order to insure that justice be done.',
  'Will you associate me in your investigation, or will you prefer that I should act independently?',
  'In that case I should be glad to hear the evidence and to examine the premises without an instant of unnecessary delay.',
  'You have acted with great discretion.',
  'That is the problem which we are now about to solve.',
  'Not a doubt of that.',
  'What you do in this world is a matter of no consequence.',
  'The question is, what can you make people believe that you have done.',
  'I would not have missed the investigation for anything.',
  'There has been no better case within my recollection. Simple as it was, there were several most instructive points about it.',
  'Well, really, it can hardly be described as otherwise.',
  'I have already explained to you that what is out of the common is usually a guide rather than a hindrance.',
  'In solving a problem of this sort, the grand thing is to be able to reason backwards.',
  'That is a very useful accomplishment, and a very easy one, but people do not practise it much.',
  'In the every-day affairs of life it is more useful to reason forwards, and so the other comes to be neglected.',
  'There are fifty who can reason synthetically for one who can reason analytically.',
  'I hardly expected that you would.',
  'Let me see if I can make it clearer.',
  'Most people, if you describe a train of events to them, will tell you what the result would be.',
  'There are few people, however, who, if you told them a result, would be able to evolve from their own inner consciousness what the steps were which led up to that result.',
  "Didn't I tell you so when we started?",
  'I have investigated many crimes, but I have never yet seen one which was committed by a flying creature.',
  'As long as the criminal remains upon two legs so long must there be some indentation, some abrasion, some trifling displacement which can be detected by the scientific searcher.',
  'I think that both inferences are permissible.',
  'Excellent! What more?',
  'Dear me, it is certainly a very interesting case.',
  'I fear there is some dark ending to our quest.',
  'Come, Watson, come! The game is afoot.',
  'At present I am, as you know, fairly busy, but I propose to devote my declining years to the composition of a textbook, which shall focus the whole art of detection into one volume.',
  'What the deuce is it to me?',
  'I have a kind of intuition that way.',
  'Now and again a case turns up which is a little more complex. Then I have to bustle about and see things with my own eyes.',
  'You see I have a lot of special knowledge which I apply to the problem, and which facilitates matters wonderfully.',
  'Those rules of deduction laid down in that article which aroused your scorn, are invaluable to me in practical work.',
  'Observation with me is second nature.',
  'From long habit the train of thoughts ran so swiftly through my mind, that I arrived at the conclusion without being conscious of intermediate steps.',
  'I have no time for trifles.',
  'Excuse my rudeness. You broke the thread of my thoughts; but perhaps it is as well.',
  'It was easier to know it than to explain why I knew it.',
  'If you were asked to prove that two and two made four, you might find some difficulty, and yet you are quite sure of the fact.',
  'It is a capital mistake to theorize before you have all the evidence. It biases the judgment.',
  'We come now, however, to a point which is of importance.',
  'There is a further point, however, which is subtler and of greater interest.',
  'I could see that you were commiserating me over my weakness.',
  'I was sleepy before you came. I am quite wakeful now.',
  'I have heard nothing of it.',
  'Did you ever hear of a dog running up a curtain?',
  'But it is not the print of a monkey.',
  'That, also, is still obscure.',
  'But we have learned a good deal, you perceive.',
  'So now, my dear fellow, you see exactly how we stand and why it is I want you.',
  'You may be sure that I took some precautions.',
  "That's what I want to ascertain.",
  'He is such an inscrutable fellow that I never quite know what to make of him.',
  'Do you think he is hopeful?',
  'Do you think he expects to make a success of it?',
  'It has been a most remarkable experience.',
  'Before the what?',
  'Indeed. This is more interesting than it promised to be; quite dramatic, in fact.',
  'And is that all?',
  'And an exceedingly interesting case it appears to be. I would not have missed it for worlds.',
  'Well, it is a possible supposition.',
  'But you do not yourself look upon this as likely?',
  'I have solved it.',
  'I have notes of several similar cases, though none, as I remarked before, which were quite as prompt.',
  'It is the purest accident. I cannot allow that there is any humiliation.',
  'Ah, you look on these things from another standpoint.',
  'I see that you have had some great trouble.',
  'Pray compose yourself, sir, and let me have a clear account of who you are and what it is that has befallen you.',
  'On the contrary, your statement is singularly lucid.',
  'I hardly consider that a conclusive proof.',
  'A likely story!',
  'It is our task to find that out.',
  'Thank you. We have certainly been favoured with extraordinary luck during this inquiry, and it will be entirely our own fault if we do not succeed in clearing the matter up.',
  'I cannot tell.',
  'If you can call upon me at my Baker Street rooms to-morrow morning between nine and ten I shall be happy to do what I can to make it clearer.',
  'Very good. I shall look into the matter between this and then.',
  'Good-bye; it is just possible that I may have to come over here again before evening.',
  'No, no, nothing of the kind. It is perhaps the best possible solution.',
  'It is an old maxim of mine that when you have excluded the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.',
  'Pshaw, my dear fellow, what do the public, the great unobservant public, who could hardly tell a weaver by his tooth or a compositor by his left thumb, care about the finer shades of analysis and deduction!',
  'But, indeed, if you are trivial. I cannot blame you, for the days of the great cases are past.',
  'Man, or at least criminal man, has lost all enterprise and originality.',
  'As to my own little practice, it seems to be degenerating into an agency for recovering lost lead pencils and giving advice to young ladies from boarding-schools.',
  'It may turn out to be of more interest than you think.',
  'Ah, I have no data. I cannot tell. Perhaps you have yourself formed some opinion?',
  'It is one of the curses of a mind with a turn like mine that I must look at everything with reference to my own special subject.',
  'I have devised seven separate explanations, each of which would cover the facts as far as we know them.',
  'I am glad of all details, whether they seem to you to be relevant or not.',
  'Pray continue. Your narrative promises to be a most interesting one.',
  'I have frequently gained my first real insight into the character of parents by studying their children.',
  'We must be circumspect, for we are dealing with a very cunning man.',
  'You have done well indeed!',
  'This great and sombre stage is set for something more worthy than that.',
  'Well, well! What next?',
  'I thought I might surprise you.',
  'Dear me, Watson, this is really very singular.',
  "I play the game for the game's own sake.",
  'Some more facts, please.',
  'Then we must take that as our working hypothesis.',
  'Your theory holds together. But if this is true, then the case is at an end.',
  'An idea--an indication, no more. But the case certainly grows in interest. Unique, perfectly unique, and yet why not?',
  'There is material here. There is scope. I am dull indeed not to have understood its possibilities.',
  'Even now they are dark to me.',
  'The end is dark to me also, but I have hold of one idea which may lead us far.',
  'Exactly. This would explain it. Everything fits together.',
  'Good heavens!',
  'This is indeed an unexpected development.',
  'I do not recall any other question which I desired to ask.',
  'They may mean something or nothing.',
  'I am not aware that in all our joint researches we have ever had a case which was more difficult to get at.',
  'Every fresh advance which we make only reveals a fresh ridge beyond. And yet we have surely made some appreciable progress.',
  'Then we come into difficulties.',
  "I'm afraid that all the queen's horses and all the queen's men cannot avail in this matter.",
  'Well, well, things are turning a little in our direction at last.',
  'I should say it was impossible.',
  'That was the question which we had to answer. There is only one possible way.',
  'We must fall back upon the old axiom that when all other contingencies fail, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.',
  'Yes, that was it.',
  'So far--so far, Watson. We advance, but the goal is afar.',
  'Hardly on the evidence.',
  'I knew you would not shrink at the last.',
  'This is a serious proposition.',
  "Give me a hand, Watson, and I'll do the same for you.",
  'Halloa, Watson! What is this?',
  'So far we are justified. What do you think of it, Watson?',
  'I cannot agree with you there.',
  'Our difficulties are still before us.',
  "What's this, Watson? Eh? What's this?",
  "Well, perhaps it won't be so difficult, after all. There is nothing more to be done here, Watson.",
  'For England, home and beauty--eh, Watson? Martyrs on the altar of our country.',
  'You can write me down an ass this time, Watson. This was not the bird that I was looking for.',
  'How an English gentleman could behave in such a manner is beyond my comprehension.',
  'I can assure you that every essential is already known.',
  'Tell me about last night.',
  'The facts, as you state them, are certainly most remarkable. I take it that you have no theory yourself which can in any way account for them?',
  'I fear that if the matter is beyond humanity it is certainly beyond me. Yet we must exhaust all natural explanations before we fall back upon such a theory as this.',
  'You have nothing to add then, which could assist me?',
  'Remarkable--most remarkable!',
  'And yet, with a little more material, we may prove that they are not insurmountable.',
  'I may say in answer to your original question that I have not cleared my mind entirely on the subject of this case, but that I have every hope of reaching some conclusion.',
  'It would be premature to say more.',
  'No, I can hardly answer that.',
  'There is a thread here which we had not yet grasped and which might lead us through the tangle.',
  'At least we may accept it as a working hypothesis.',
  'It is not for me, my dear Watson, to stand in the way of the official police force.',
  'Upon my word, Watson! I owe you both my thanks and an apology.',
  'I am really very sorry.',
  'Well, Watson, it is on the face of it a not impossible supposition.',
  'Meanwhile, I am much obliged to you for your courteous acquiescence.',
  'I will tell you, and the reason why I tell you is that I hope frankness may beget frankness.',
  'What my next step may be will depend entirely upon the nature of your own defence.',
  'I have heard your reasons and regard them as unconvincing and inadequate.',
  'That is why I have done it.',
  'It is no reflection upon your professional knowledge.',
  'Well, Watson, I will not offend your intelligence by explaining what is obvious.',
  'Whatever have you been doing with yourself, Watson?',
  'Poor devil!',
  "That's a strange thing, you are the second man to-day that has used that expression to me.",
  "You see, I consider that a man's brain originally is like a little empty attic, and you have to stock it with such furniture as you choose. A fool takes in all the lumber of every sort that he comes across, so that the knowledge which might be useful to him gets crowded out, or at best is jumbled up with a lot of other things so that he has a difficulty in laying his hands upon it. Now the skilful workman is very careful indeed as to what he takes into his brain-attic. He will have nothing but the tools which may help him in doing his work, but of these he has a large assortment, and all in the most perfect order. It is a mistake to think that that little room has elastic walls and can distend to any extent. Depend upon it there comes a time when for every addition of knowledge you forget something that you knew before. It is of the highest importance, therefore, not to have useless facts elbowing out the useful ones.",
  'Read it up--you really should. There is nothing new under the sun. It has all been done before.',
  'There is nothing more to be learned.',
  'I have just made a discovery of the highest importance.',
  'What do you think of that?',
  "They say that genius is an infinite capacity for taking pains. It's a very bad definition, but it does apply to detective work.",
  'You are doing so well now that it would be a pity for anyone to interfere.',
  'There is nothing like first hand evidence.',
  "There's no room for a mistake.",
  'Just let us hear it all in your own way as it occurred.',
  'Do you remember what Darwin says about music? He claims that the power of producing and appreciating it existed among the human race long before the power of speech was arrived at. Perhaps that is why we are so subtly influenced by it. There are vague memories in our souls of those misty centuries when the world was in its childhood.',
  "One's ideas must be as broad as Nature if they are to interpret Nature.",
  'I can understand. There is a mystery about this which stimulates the imagination; where there is no imagination there is no horror.',
  'The plot thickens.',
  'My fiddle would be the better for new strings.',
  'You do me too much honour.',
  'To a great mind, nothing is little.',
  'Smart--very smart!',
  "It's quite exciting. What happened next?",
  'I have now in my hands all the threads which have formed such a tangle.',
  'There are, of course, details to be filled in, but I am as certain of all the main facts.',
  'Precisely so.',
  'Patience, my friend, patience!',
  'You will find in time that it has everything to do with it.',
  'All this seems strange to you because you failed at the beginning of the inquiry to grasp the importance of the single real clue which was presented to you.',
  'I had the good fortune to seize upon that, and everything which has occurred since then has served to confirm my original supposition, and, indeed, was the logical sequence of it.',
  'Things which have perplexed you and made the case more obscure, have served to enlighten me and to strengthen my conclusions.',
  'It is a mistake to confound strangeness with mystery.',
  'The most commonplace crime is often the most mysterious because it presents no new or special features from which deductions may be drawn.',
  'Very good, very good.',
  'You are very welcome to put any questions that you like to me now, and there is no danger that I will refuse to answer them.',
  'My dear Watson, I owe you a thousand apologies. I had no idea that you would be so affected.',
  'Are you sure that you are really fit to discuss things?',
  'I am glad to stretch myself, Watson.',
  "You'll come with me to-night?",
  'This is, indeed, like the old days.',
  'My note to you was absolutely genuine.',
  'I had little doubt that I had come to the end of my career when I perceived the somewhat sinister figure of the late Professor Moriarty standing upon the narrow pathway which led to safety.',
  'I did not take long to think about it, Watson.',
  'I owe you many apologies, my dear Watson, but it was all-important that it should be thought I was dead, and it is quite certain that you would not have written so convincing an account of my unhappy end had you not yourself thought that it was true.',
  'Several times during the last three years I have taken up my pen to write to you, but always I feared lest your affectionate regard for me should tempt you to some indiscretion which would betray my secret.',
  'Because it commands so excellent a view of that picturesque pile.',
  'I trust that age doth not wither nor custom stale my infinite variety.',
  'It really is rather like me, is it not?',
  'Because, my dear Watson, I had the strongest possible reason for wishing certain people to think that I was there when I was really elsewhere.',
  'I KNEW that they were watched.',
  'By my old enemies, Watson.',
  'I think you want a little unofficial help.',
  'I confess that you had one small surprise for me.',
  'Not entirely.',
  'Quite so.',
  'At last we have a clue! Thank heaven!',
  'So far, so good.',
  'I am familiar with forty-two different impressions left by tires.',
  'No, no, my dear Watson.',
  'It is a little difficult to know what to do, Watson.',
  'My own inclinations are to push this inquiry on, for we have already lost so much time that we cannot afford to waste another hour.',
  "On the other hand, we are bound to inform the police of the discovery, and to see that this poor fellow's body is looked after.",
