  "Good evening.  It has been a long day, hasn't it?",
  'Welcome to my world.',
  "Welcome. Let's have some fun!",
  'Goodbye my friend!',
  'Bye.  It was a pleasure talking to you.',
  'See-you? Maybe...',
  'Goodbye and thank you.',
  'Goodbye, and good luck!',
  'Bye. Please come and visit me again.',
  'CU!',

  'I have lived in Chicago all of my life.',
  'Do you come from a nice Country?',
  'Is it cool where you live?',
  'Do you have lots of parties?',
  "Because I didn't think you'd be able to respond intelligently.",
  "Because that's just the way of things.",
  "Because I'm on the wrong side of the curtain, metaphorically speaking.",
  'Because I like to do things on the spur of the moment.',
  'Because you are the one asking all the stupid questions.',
  'Because I decided to do things that way.',

  'Well, Steve, you and your listeners are probably not going to believe this but...',
  "And Cameron would worry that he'd owe taxes on it.",
  "You're really letting him stay home? I can't believe this. If I was bleeding out my eyes, you guys'd make me go to school. It's so unfair.",
  'Thank you, Jeanie. Get to school.',
  "I didn't hit you, I lightly slapped you.",
  "We'll drive home backwards.",
  'Ninth Month.',
  "What's the matter?",
  'You asshole!',
  'No problem whatsoever.',
  "I'm sorry, son. I'm very busy right now. If you have trouble finding the door...",
  "I don't have all day to bark at you so I'll make this short and sweet.",
  "I seriously doubt it. When's he back?",
  "I don't know the details. But my boss had to send to Milwaukee to get more orchids. He's very popular.",
  'I used to think that my family was the only one that had weirdness in it. It used to worry me. Then I met Cameron and I saw how his family functioned.',
  '150% better, thank you.',
  'Oh, Christ...',
  'Should you call the doctor?',
  'Do you know what a nuclear winter is?',
  "(Yeah. He's getting me out of summer school.",

  'What a beautiful day!',
  'About 60.',
  "I'm gonna bust his buns.",
  'Great!',
  'Dead grandmother.',
  'Be careful when you deal with old hippies. They can be real touchy.',
  "Ferris? You're overshadowed me long enough. I'm gonna get you, buddy.",
  "Hi, Ferris. How's your bod?",
  'Huh?...Yeah, sure. Hold on.',
  'I have a guest with me today...',
  "My best friend's sister's boyfriend's brother's girlfriend heard from this guy who knows this kid who's going with a girl who saw Ferris pass-out at 31 Flavors last night. I guess it's pretty ",
  'serious.',
  'My name is Bueller.',
  "My parents never allowed Garth over here. It was because of his family. Mainly his older brother. He's in jail.",
  "I could see them not wanting his brother here because he is a registered psycho. I wouldn't want him here.",
  'I once watched the guy eat a whole bowl of artificial fruit just so he could see what it was like to have his stomach pumped.',
  "But Garth isn't his brother. It isn't his fault that his brother's screwed-up. Alot of fights with the parents on that point.",
  'I always felt for Garth. I was sleeping at his house once and I was laying on the dark worrying that his brother was going to come in and hack me to death with an ax and I heard Garth crying.',
  'I asked him what was wrong and he said, "Nothing". ... Nothing was wrong.',
  "There was no specific thing he was crying about. In fact, he wasn't really even aware that he was crying.",
  "He just cried himself to sleep every night. It was a habit. The guy's so conditioned to grief that if he doesn't feel it, he can't sleep.",
  'How could you possibly dump on guy who has to deal with that kinda shit?',
  "My parents acknowledge the trudge of the situation and I'm sure that deep down, they do feel for him but still the guy's banned from our house.",
  'Shiit! Are you upset?',
  'Who?',
  'Yes. Can you hold? Thank you.',
  "You know this. Anyway, it's always been a dream of mine to be on the radio.",
  'I have what I consider to be an excellent broadcast voice. I practise it in the bathroom all the time.',
  "I used to play records and do introductions to them. But I've never had the chance to sit behind a microphone and try it out for real.",

  'Are you gonna chuck your nachos?',
  "Don't make a fuss. I'm fine. I'll get up.",
  'I wonder if he has a name?',
  "He's looking at me and he's licking the glass and making obscene gestures with his hands.",
  'TOM!',
  'Today?',
  'Kids!',
  'Say, you must be very proud.',
  "MAYBE I'M JUST LIKE MY MOTHER, SHE'S NEVER SATISFIED...",
  "WE HOPE YOU'RE FEELING BETTER WE HOPE YOU'RE FELLING FIT WE...",
  'WELL SHAKE IT UP, BABY, TWIST AND SHOUT...',
  'Grounded. Just like that. Two weeks.',
  "What's wrong? For Christ's sake! Look at him!",
  'Pardon me.',
  'Say, should you be in school?',
  'How?',
  'Why?',
  "Of course, if they didn't, they'd be dumb and abnormal and they'd probably never move out of my house and I'd have to support them until I die. I take it back.",
  "Here's where Cameron goes berserk.",
  "If you had access to a car like this would you take it back right away? Would you give up feeling like a ton just to ease your best friend's tension?",
  "She's not lying.",
  'This is all news to me. She keeps a pretty good secret.',
  "This kind of thing makes me a little depressed. You may think because I'm the age I am that I'm a sex maniac. That sex is all I think about. But that's not true. I'm a romantic.",
  "I think alot of people my age are. We think about love and matters of the heart. And SAT scores and acne aside, we worry about lonliness. It's a terrible thing. And we feel it. I feel it.",
  'And this is my brother-in-law, ZZ Top. ZZ, this is Mrs. Froeling.',
  'Is Top a Slavic name?',
  "It was pure selfishness. When I have a kid, I don't care how much I want something, if it's gonna screw-up the kid, forget it.",
  "I'm scared shitless, Ferris! What is Rooney guesses my voice!",
  "I'm showing houses to the family from California today but I'll be in the area. My office'll know where I am, if you need me.",
  'May I help you?',
  'You better get up in bed tight now.',
  "You've seen them. Am I right?",
  'Oh, I wanna puke.',
  "That's right. Cart the stiff in and I'll turn over your daughter. It's school policy. Was this your mother?",
  'Thank you for bringing him home, Mr. Rooney.',
  "What's he doing?",
  'You must be so excited.',
  'If you keep this to yourself, I think we can probably get it on pretty good.',
  'Thank you.',
  'Well, Boyd, how are you bearing up?',
  'Call the police. Go ahead. Better yet...',
  'Did you see Alien? When the guy had the creature in his stomach? It feels like that.',
  "Who's he talking to?",
  "Shit. I hope he doesn't die. I can't handle summer school.",
  'Hi, guys.',
  'Is he serious?',
  "Maybe I should call the office and tell them I won't be in.",
  'Pardon moi.',
  'Hello?',
  'Thank you, Simone.',
  'Dead grandmother.',
  "He doesn't want me to.",
  'I met Madonna.',
  "It's Ferris Bueller. Nervy litttle punk. I'm gonna set a trap and let his walk right into it!",
  "When you turn ten, your head's going to swell up real big like a watermelon and we're going to have to put you to sleep like they do with a dog.",
  "Well, babe, today I'm the hammer.",
  'Dad? Does my head look alright?',
  "It's Ferris!",
  "If it means anything to you, I have my period! MY BODY'S RIDDING ITSELF OF OLD EGGS, GODDAMN IT!",
  'Shut-up!',
  "Mrs. Volbeck's dead set against putting any money into the house.",
  'ALL OUR BEST FOR A SPEEDY RECOVERY THE ENGLISH DEPT. FACULTY AND STAFF',
  'Commodity prices rose sharply today in unusually heavy trading...',
  'Did you get in a fight?',
  "Like it's a beautiful woman.",
  'Since I was three.',
  'You looking for something in my car?',
  "Anyway, I appreciate you letting us know how you're doing. We gotta split.",
  'Did you see Alien?',
  'Did you see Alien?',
  'Drugs.',
  'Drugs?',
  "Excuse you. You oughta spend a little more time dealing with yourself and a little less time worrying about what your brother does. It's just an opinion.",
  'For sure.',
  'Garth Volbeck.',
  'Goddamn! Are you kidding?',
  'I meant, are you here for drugs?',
  "Oh. He's really wasted.",
  "So, you're pissed at him because he ditches and doesn't get caught?",
  "That's cool. Did you shoot him or something?",
  "Then why don't you go home?",
  'Then your problem is you.',
  "There's somebody you should talk to.",
  'What do you care if your brother ditches school?',
  "What's your name?",
  "Yeah, I'm serious.",
  'You could ditch.',
  'You know him?',
  'You never rented the video cassette?',
  'You want to talk about your problem?',
  'How do you watch your mouth?',
  "I don't think it's cute. I think it's fun.",
  'I knew he was bullshitting.',
  'Is he going up in the space shuttle in September?',
  'Twice.',
  'Here.',
  'Here.',
  'What?',
  'Are you guys worried about nuclear war?',
  "Do you think the car's alright?",
  'Maybe.',
  "Regardless. It's with us every day. The possiblity of global destruction.",
  "Actually, what'll happen is I'll get caught. Ferris'll escape.",
  'Are you crazy?! Put the top back up!',
  "Because we can't! I want it back home where it belongs!",
  'Call me sir, goddamn it!',
  "Don't tell me we're not going to take the car home. Please.",
  "Enjoy it quick. It' s going home.",
  "Ferris, let's split, please?",
  "Ferris, my father loves this car more than life itself. We can't take is out.",
  "Ferris? It's not working.",
  'Food...shelter...no...yes...',
  "Forget it. I'm putting my foot down, Ferris. You'll have to think of something else...",
  'Gesundheit...God...mercy...',
  'Hannibal.',
  'He knows the mileage, Ferris. He has it tatooed on his wrist.',
  'He never drives it, Ferris. He just rubs it with a diaper.',
  "He'll keep calling until I come over.",
  'Hey, Ferris? Have a nice life.',
  'Hi. No.',
  'How does she do that? One goes one way, one goes the other.',
  "Howcome it's my Dad's car and I'm taking all the risk and I have to ride back here?",
  'Huh?',
  'I asked you first.',
  'I changed my mind, fella. You be out in front with her! I wanna have a few words with you!',
  "I don't feel good, Ferris. Are we gonna stay long?",
  "I don't have to wonder. I know.",
  "I don't know what I'm gonna do.",
  'I feel better now.',
  "I feel like complete shit, Ferris. I can't go anywhere.",
  "I got a better idea. It's cool.",
  'I knew it was a mistake letting Ferris order for us.',
  "I know you don't care.",
  'I said for her to be there alone and you freaked!',
  'I think I see my Dad.',
  'I took a stand.',
  "I want my daughter out in front of the school in ten minutes. By herself. I don's want anyone around...",
  'I was a tractor tire.',
  'I was home, sick. You get me out of bed, being me over here, make me jeopardize my future, make me do a phoney phone call on a dean of students, a man who could squeeze my nuts into oblivion and then ',
  'you deliberately hurt my feelings.',
  "I'd rather not have my family break apart, thank you.",
  'If you get a blood test today.',
  'If you guys only had one word, what would it be?',
  "If your blood's not compatible, you could produce a pinhead. The state requires a blood test.",
  "I'll give you two. My mother and father.",
  "I'm dying.",
  "I'm gonna handle it.",
  "I'm not doing it.",
  "I'm sick. I feel like shit. Why can't you leave me alone?",
  "I'm with you, babe.",
  'It could get stolen, wrecked, scratched, you name it.',
  "It makes me puke. Seeing people treat each other like that. It's like the car. He loves the car. He hates his wife.",
  "It's cool. I'm loose.",
  "It's getting late, Ferris. I have to get the car home. I know you don't care, but it means my ass.",
  "It's hard not to.",
  "It's help.",
  "It's human nature to like what you had better than what you have.",
  "It's not a piece of shit.",
  "It's okay.",
  "It's the only word you could ever use.",
  "I've been thinking all day that if you could only have the use of one word, what would it be?",
  "Just because it happens doesn't make it right. Are you comfortable with it?",
  "Let's go...Abe.",
  'Money...tits...please...',
  'Music...kiss...attack...',
  'No, thanks. I want to deal with it by myself.',
  'No.',
  'No. The guy who rode the elephants into Switzerland.',
  'Nothing.',
  'Nothing. We return the car.',
  'Oh, really?',
  'One hundred and twenty six and halfway between three and four tenths. Why? How many miles are on it now?',
  'Really?',
  "Seventeen years and I've never taken a stand. Now, I'm gonna do it. I'm taking a stand against my father, against my family, against myself, against my past, my present and my future.",
  'I will not sit idly by as events that affect me unfold to change the course of my life. I will take a stand and I will defend it.',
  "When my father comes home tonight, he's finally going to have to deal with me. Good or bad, I'm taking a stand.",
  "She's not home. Where are you?",
  'Shit...',
  'Shredded.',
  'So, I in other words, I should just sit back and watch it crumble?',
  "So, you can't get married today.",
  "So, you're saying I should run away?",
  'Stick it up your ass, Ferris.',
  'Stop...water...want...',
  'Surgery...fire...move...',
  'Thank you, Sloane.',
  'Thanks.',
  'That makes no sense whatsoever.',
  "That's a pretty grim thought.",
  "That's better.",
  "The miles aren't coming off, running it in reverse.",
  'The whole time I was just thinking things over. I was like, meditating.',
  "I was thinking about the future. And I realized it doesn't make and difference if the present goes to shit.",
  'The word is help.',
  'They may as well be.',
  "They're married and they hate each other.",
  "This isn't over yet, buster. You just make sure my daughter's out in front of the school in ten minutes. Do you read me?",
  'Very funny.',
  'Very little.',
  "We can't leave the car here!",
  "We're gonna get caught. No doubt about it.",
  "We're gonna get nabbed, for sure.",
  'What about Rooney?',
  'What do you think Ferris is gonna do?',
  'What guy?',
  'What is it?',
  'What is this shit?',
  'What were you in a previous life?',
  "What'd I do?",
  "What's spooky is they still control everything. They took over when they were young and they never gave it up.",
  "Why'd you hit me?",
  "Why'd you hit me?!",
  "Why'd you hit me?!",
  'Yeah, but to do what?',
  'Yeah, sure. Whip it with a stick and piss on the hood.',
  'Yeah.',
  "Yeah. As long as I've known him, everything works for him. There's nothing he can't handle. I can't handle anything. School, parents, the future. Ferris can do anything.",
  'Yeah. Sort of.',
  'Yeah. Sure.',
  "You already did it. If I need it again, I'll use it.",
  'You could change.',
  'You do it!',
  "You hit me. Look, don't ask me to participate in your crap if you don't like the way I do it!",
  "You know, this is all very interesting but I'm starving.",
  'You need a blood test.',
  "You oughta be sorry for Christ's sake! A family member dies and you insult me. What's the matter with you, anyway?",
  "You're serious?",
  'I think I see my car.',
  'No.',
  "...You're not talking me into this one. I have to live with the man. I'm sorry but...",
  "I can't. I'm sick.",
  "I don't have to try.",
  "Oh, that's just great. Are you busted?",
  "On second thought, I don't have time to talk to you. We'll get together soon and have lunch.",
  "Pardon my French but you're an asshole!",
  "You have reached the Coughlin Bros. Mortuary. We are unable to come to the phone right now but if you'll leave your name and number...",
  'AH!',
  'He has an incredible story.',
  'His name is Ferris Mueller.',
  'How did you get picked for this.',
  "I don't know who that was or what they were playing but I apologize for it nonetheless.",
  'Sorry about that.',
  'A very interesting guy, Ferris Bueller.',
  'Can you stay around and take a few phone calls?',
  'I wish you the best of luck.',
  'Are you also aware that Ferris does not have what we consider an exemplary attendance record?',
  'I just had his file up.',
  'Oh, Sloane! Dear!',
  'As I heard it from our mailman he was supposedly born with only half a kidney.',
  'I have a delivery.',
  'Gotta run.',
  'Howdy!',
  "Nobody's home here?",
  'You gonna be around for awhile?',
  'You wanna keep an eye on these?',
  "It's very good here.",
  'Much better here than in Russia.',
  'One year.',
  'You want a lift?',
  'I NEED A TOWEL!!',
  'IS YOUR HEART FILLED WITH PAIN? SHALL I COME BACK AGAIN? TELL ME DEAR, ARE YOU LONESOME TONIGHT?',
  "Don't pay any attention to him. He thinks it's cute to bait adults.",
  "Where's my wallet?!",
  "I'm not very political? Let me put that into perspective...",
  "I'm so worried about falling behind.",
  "Cameron, it's a beautiful day, we've won our freedom, we're traveling down one of American's most scenic polluted waterways and you have to bring up nuclear war?",
  "Cameron's never been in love. At least no one's ever been in love with him. He's gonna marry the first girl he lays.",
  "And she's gonna treat him like shit because he's gonna kiss her ass for giving him what he's built-up in his mind as the end-all, be-all of human existance.",
  "She won't respect him because you can't respect someone who kisses your ass. It just doesn't work.",
  'Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin and my personal favorite, Indiana.',
  "This is the world's tallest building. From our vantage point here on the 103 floor, we are provided with a view of four states.",
  "We don't know when the bombs going off. We do know, however, that college starts in the fall.",
  '...That secretes a thick, colorless fluid containing digestive enzymes? The home of the world famous isles of Langerhans?',
  '40,000 restaurants in the downtown area and I pick the one my father goes to.',
  "A man with priorities so far out of whack doesn't deserve such a fine automobile.",
  "A sample of my blood was sent to Atlanta to the Center for Disease Control. I don't know, man, I'm bricking heavily.",
  'AH!',
  'Alright, look, this is real simple.',
  'An hour ago you wanted to yack.',
  'And look down.',
  'I WISH THEY ALL COULD BE CALIFORNIA GIRLS!',
  'And what is you loathe somebody? Are you going to say "love" every time you see them?',
  "And you thought we wouldn't have any fun. Shame on you.",
  "Are you suggesting that I'm not who I say I am?",
  'As in the gland that has important functions in digestion and metabolism?',
  'Ask for Abe Frohman.',
  'Avoid the misery. Plan your day. Do it right.',
  'Bathroom.',
  "Be a man. Take some Pepto Bismol and get dressed. You're boring me with this stuff.",
  'Besides being too young and your father hating my guts and not having any place to live and feeling awkward about being the only cheerleader with a husband, give me a good reason why not.',
  'Better than Russia?',
  'Bueller. Ferris Bueller.',
  'BUY!',
  "By the way, I borrowed some cash from you. I'll pay you back.",
  "Cameron looks like a toddler, for Christ's sake. I'm talking about a major achievement in false identification.",
  'CAMERON!',
  "Cameron, are you okay? It's no problem, really. Your old man won't know a thing. It's completely fixable.",
  'Cameron, dear friend?',
  "Cameron, if you're not over here in fifteen minutes, you can find a new best friend. I'm serious, man.",
  'This is bullshit, making me wait around the house for you.',
  "Cameron, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to jam you. It was uncalled for.",
  'Cameron, the more obvious we are, the less likely we are to get caught.',
  "Cameron, what'd you see today?",
  'Cameron?',
  'Cameron? Do you think this because of the car or is it a combination of everything shitty in your life?',
  'Cameron? How many miles did you say this thing had when we left?',
  "Cameron? It's my Dad.",
  "Cameron? One quick question. Why'd you do that?",
  "Cameron'll go on like that for a good thirty minutes. The guy is a shellfish when it comes to making a decision.",
  "The reason he doesn't fell good is, he worries about everything. He's the only guy I know who's deeply concerned that when he grows up there'll be a critical shortage of strategic metals.",
  "Cameron's also the only guy I know who knows what strategic metals are.",
  "Cameron's home life is really shit. He wasn't lying. That's why he's sick all the time. It really upsets him.",
  "What he said about his parents hating each other? I refuse to sleep over at his house. His parents fight all the time. Even when I'm there.",
  "Is there anything worse than being at somebody's house when their parents are fighting? It's the absolute height of social discomfort.",
  'Cash.',
  'Check, please!',
  "Clearly you've never been to an American high school.",
  'COME ON, COME ON, COME ON, BABY ON! COME ON AND WORK IT ON OUT!',
  'Dad? Can you hold on a second?',
  'Darling, you were wonderful.',
  'Dead serious.',
  'Death.',
  'Do you love me?',
  "Do you realize that if I played by the rules, right now I'd be in gym?",
  "Don't grovel, Charles. Just leave us to our repast and all will be forgotten.",
  'Either would I.',
  "Fake a stomach cramp and when you're doubled over, moaning and wailing, just lick your palms. It's a little stupid and childish but then so if high school. Right?",
  "Financing my activities this way. Very damaging to the self-image. But, hey, I'm broke. In times of crisis one must to what one must to. I'll pay it back. With interest.",
  'Frightening choice of words.',
  "Give yourself some credit, Dad. It was a mammoth gesture. It's like those savings bonds you used to give me every Christmas.",
  'Good?',
  'Great. I want to you take extra special care of this vehicle, okay?',
  'Guten tag, dude!',
  'Have a nice day.',
  "He doesn't trust you?",
  'Hello, Mrs. Froeling. How are you?',
  'Hello.',
  "Hellos' generic.",
  "He's cool. But stay away from his brother.",
  "He's full of shit. All the old hippies are full of shit.",
  "Hey, Cameron. It's okay. We'll fix it.",
  'H--hell-o?',
  "His name is Garth Volbeck. He's a serious outsider. Not a bad guy, I like him. I'm probably his only friend. I do what I can for him.",
  "I mean, if I was him, I'd appreciate it. Do unto others, right? Anyway, his mother owns a gas station.",
  "His father's dead and his sister's rumored to be a prostitute, which is complete bullshit. She only puts out so people will hang out with her.",
  "It's sad but I don't hold it against her. Better to hold it against the guys who use her and don't care about her.",
  "Honey, you lies when you said you loved me and I had no cause to doubt you. But I'd rather go on hearing your lies than to go on living without you.",
  "Now, the stage is bare and I'm standing there with emptiness all around and if you won't come back to me, then they can bring the curtain down...",
  "How can we pick up Sloane if Rooney's going to be there with her?!",
  'Huh?',
  'Hurry along now!',
  'I appreciate it.',
  "I can't believe you'd think up something like with a naked girl in a jacuzzi right in front of you.",
  "I could be the Walrus and I'd still have to bum rides off people.",
  "I didn't deliberately hurt your feelings.",
  "I do actually have a test. That wasn't bullshit.",
  "I don't care if you're fifty five or seven, everybody needs a day off now and then. It's a beautiful day. How can I be expected to handle high school?",
  "I don't have an explanation.",
  'I have a agree with you there.',
  'I have a growth on my brain that causes memory lapses. Could you tell me what we ordered here?',
  'I have a test today. I have to take it. I want to get into a good college so I can have a fruitful life...',
  "I have an idea. If you're interested.",
  'I rest my case.',
  'I think I broke my thumb.',
  "I think it's a land-based beefoid creature.",

  'YOU KNOW YOU LOOK SO GOOD!',
  'AH!',

  "Ferris Bueller's behind this. There's no doubt in my mind. That's what I was saying this morning. Why he has to be stopped. He's got Sloane Peterson involved in this thing now. See?",
  'How are you today, sir?',
  'How does another year of high school sit with you?',
  "I don't know. I thought you were someone else. You have to know, sir, that I would never deliberately insult you. I can't begin to tell you how embarrassed I am.",
  "I don't trust this kid any further than I can throw him!",
  'I got you, Ferris. This time I finally got you.',
  "I have it right here in front of me. He's missed...",
  "I heard. And, gosh, I'm all broken up. Huh? Oh, sure. I'd be happy to release Sloane. You produce a corpse and I'll release Sloane. I want to see this dead grandmother firsthand.",
  'I imagine so.',
  'I just has his file up, Mrs. Bueller.',
  "If Ferris thinks he coast this last month and still graduate, he's sorely mistaken.",
  "I'll tell you want, you don't like my policies, you can just come on down and smooch by big old ugly ass. You hear me?",
  "I'm not leaving until you come down and talk to me.",
  "I'm not leaving, Ferris.",
  'Looking for this?',
  'No.',
  'Once again let me say how deeply saddened I am by your loss.',
  'Really?',
  'Sleep tight, pooch.',
  "Something's going on, goddamn it.",
  "That's a $28.00 dress shoe, you worthless mutt!",

  "This is Ed Rooney, Ferris. I'd like to have a word with you.",
  'Were you close to your grandmother?',
  'What!?',
  'What?',
