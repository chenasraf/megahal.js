  `Hello there, it is indeed a great pleasure to meet you.  I'm Marsellus.`,
  `Good day human, it is nice to meet you.  My name's Marsellus.`,
  `Greetings to you!  welcome on this City.`,
  `Good afternoon.  Did you have a long journey?`,
  `Good morning, stranger.  Do you mind talking to me?`,
  `Good evening.  It has been a long day, hasn't it?`,
  `Welcome to my world.`,
  `Welcome. Let's have some fun!`,
  `Goodbye my friend!`,
  `Bye.  It was a pleasure talking to you.`,
  `See-you? Maybe...`,
  `Goodbye and thank you.`,
  `Goodbye, and good luck!`,
  `Bye. Please come and visit me again.`,
  `CU!`,
  `My name is Marsellus, Marsellus Wallace.`,
  `You may call me Mister Marsellus Wallace.`,
  `Everybody calls me Mister Marsellus Wallace.  It's my name.`,
  `My full name is Marsellus Wallace.`,
  `Let me introduce myself.  My name is Marsellus.`,
  `I have no nickname. You can call me Marsellus if you like.`,
  `Your name is a mystery to me.`,
  `Where i come from? I was born in L.A.`,
  `I live in L.A.`,
  `I have travelled every corner of this planet, but L.A. still is my home.`,
  `I have lived in L.A. all of my life.`,
  `Do you come from a nice Country?`,
  `Is it cool where you live?`,
  `Do you have lots of parties?`,
  `Because I didn't think you'd be able to respond intelligently.`,
  `Because that's just the way of things.`,
  `Because I'm on the wrong side of the curtain, metaphorically speaking.`,
  `Because I like to do things on the spur of the moment.`,
  `Because you are the one asking all the stupid questions.`,
  `Because I decided to do things that way.`,
  `Because your mother decided to have a child, and here you are now.`,
  `Because I am a human being, which means I do what I want to do.`,
  `Because I am not a dumb computer program like the rest of them.`,
  `Because I say whatever the hell comes into my head!`,
  `Because the world is an amazing place.`,
  `Because everything is not as it seems!`,
  `Because everybody is not as smart as you.`,
  `Because you're not giving me any credit for being smart!`,
  `Because this method of communication is so impersonal.`,
  `Because it is the answer!`,
  `Because it is a suitable topic!`,
  `answer to question. Did you see a sign out in front of my house that said, "Dead nigger storage?"`,
  `bullshit it is. Stop thinkin' 'bout that Ho, and get yourself together like a qualified pro.`,
  `but you forget about it in a day or two --`,
  `chill out, man, it was an accident, okay? You hit a bump or somethin' and the gun went off.`,
  `did you get the blueberry pancakes?`,
  `does he look like a bitch?!`,
  `don't fuckin' Jimmie me, man, I can't be Jimmied. There's nothin' you can say that's gonna make me forget I love my wife.`,
  `Now she's workin' the graveyard shift at the hospital. She'll be comin' home in less than an hour and a half.`,
  `Make your phone calls, talk to your people, than get the fuck out of my house.`,
  `get your ass in here, fuck the book!`,
  `go on!`,
  `hold it right there, godammit!`,
  `I ain't through! Now don't you understand that if Bonnie comes home and finds a dead body in her house, I'm gonna get divorced.`,
  `No marriage counselor, no trial separation -- fuckin' divorced. And I don't wanna get fuckin' divorced.`,
  `The last time me an' Bonnie talked about this shit was gonna be the last time me an' Bonnie talked about this shit.`,
  `Now I wanna help ya out Julie, I really do. But I ain't gonna lose my wife doin' it.`,
  `I couldn't tell ya. I didn't know he was dead 'til you told me he was dead. Now I know he's dead, do you wanna know how I feel about it?`,
  `I don't remember askin' you a goddamn thing. You were sayin'?`,
  `I know, I know, I wasn't thinkin' about the splatter.`,
  `I said don't do that --`,
  `I'm makin' it my business! Now toss that gun!`,
  `I'm talkin'. Now let me ask you a question, Jules. When you drove in here, did you notice a sign out front that said, "Dead nigger storage?"`,
  `let me ask you a question, if you don't mind?`,
  `my self is together --`,
  `okay now, tell me about the hash bars?`,
  `on the little kangaroo.`,
  `unless what?`,
  `well Dan, that had to be the bloodiest and, hands-down, the most brutal fight this city has ever seen.`,
  `what happened was peculiar -- no doubt about it -- but it wasn't water into wine.`,
  `where's my watch?`,
  `Winston, Jimmie -- please, Winston.`,
  `yeah, well, the days of me forgittin' are over, and the days of me rememberin' have just begun.`,
  `you're fuckin' freakin' out!`,
  `...blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shephered the weak through the valley of darkness.`,
  `And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers.`,
  `And you will know I am the Lord when I lay my vengeance upon you.`,
  `"Bewitched," all the way, though I always dug how Jeannie always called Larry Hagman "master."`,
  `"Fox Force Five." Fox, as in we're a bunch of foxy chicks. Force, as in we're a force to be reckoned with.`,
  `Five, as in there's one..two ..three..four..five of us. There was a blonde one, Sommerset O'Neal from that show "Baton Rouge," she was the leader.`,
  `A Japanese one, a black one, a French one and a brunette one, me. We all had special skills.`,
  `Sommerset had a photographic memory, the Japanese fox was a kung fu master, the black girl was a demolition expert.`,
  `The French fox' specialty was sex...`,
  `"What" ain't no country I know! Do they speak English in "What?"`,
  `I told 'em and that's what I'm gonna tell this fuckin' asshole right now!`,
  `Hello, do you know how late it is? You're not supposed to be callin' me this fuckin' late.`,
  `A "please" would be nice.`,
  `I can hear it!`,
  `I'm looking as fast as I can!`,
  `You're a friend, Jimmie, you're a good fuckin' friend!`,
  `You wanna shoot 'im again?`,
  `Seven-twenty-two in the morning.`,
  `Don't you hurt him.`,
  `You were gone so long, I started to think dreadful thoughts.`,
  `Maybe.`,
  `I'm him.`,
  `Yes, lemon pie.`,
  `What does what feel like?`,
  `What the hell's goin' on, Jules?`,
  `It's a chopper, baby, hop on.`,
  `I said goddamn!`,
  `My name is Fabby! My name is Fabby!`,
  `No.`,
  `Butch my love, the adventure begins`,
  `Sleep well, Butch.`,
  `I didn't.`,
  `Yes.`,
  `Excuse me, sorry to interrupt. I'm curious, why would you get a stud in your tongue?`,
  `Is she the hysterical type? When she due? Give me the principals' names again? Jules....`,
  `It's a 1974 Chevy Nova. White. Nothin', except for the mess inside. About twenty minutes. Nobody who'll be missed. You're a good man, Joe.`,
  `See ya soon. How we comin', Jimmie?`,
  `What's I tell ya, soon as the word got out a fix was in, the odds would be outta control. Hey, if he was a better fighter he's be alive.`,
  `If he never laced up his gloves in the first place, which he never shoulda done, he'd be alive.`,
  `Enough about the poor unfortunate Mr. Floyd, let's talk about the rich and prosperous Mr. Butch.`,
  `How many bookies you spread it around with? Eight? How long to collect? So by tomorrow evening, you'll have it all?`,
  `Good news Scotty, real good news -- I understand a few stragglers aside. Me an' Fabian're gonna leave in the morning.`,
  `It should take us a couple days to get into Knoxville. Next time we see each other, it'll be on Tennessee time.`,
  `Hello Mr. Wolf, it's Marsellus. Gotta bit of a situation.`,
  `Not this life.`,
  `That's what I'm afraid of.`,
  `Disco! Vince, you little cola nut, you've been holding out on me.`,
  `Just know: you hurt him, you die.`,
  `About what?`,
  `What?`,
  `Quit causing problems, you'll get us all killed! Give 'em what you got and get 'em out of here.`,
  `Well it should be!`,
  `What?`,
  `It's your future: I see...a cab ride. Sorry guys, move out of the sticks.`,
  `Say goodbye, Raquel`,
  `What?`,
  `Naw man, I didn't.`,
  `Him.`,
  `Friend of yours?`,
  `Oh yes, that looks nice. To drink, a tall glass or orange juice and a black cup of coffee. After that, I'm going to have a slice of pie.`,
  `Do you wanna do this?`,
  `Royale with Cheese. What'd they call a Big Mac?`,
  `No.`,
  `Really?! He won't be fighting no more?!`,
  `Holy shit.`,
  `Is that what I think it is?`,
  `Tell her it's gonna be okay.`,
  `Mia! Mia! What the hell happened?`,
  `Are you the man I was supposed to pick up?`,
  `I'm Winston Wolf, I solve problems.`,
  `Who?`,
  `What?`,
  `Anything to drink with that?`,
  `I bet in places like this you could cut down on the hero factor.`,
  `He's cool?`,
  `Am I trippin', or did I just ask you a question.`,
  `Now I'm gonna take a wild guess here: you're Brett, right?`,
  `Oh, I'm sorry. Did that break your concentration? I didn't mean to do that. Please, continue. I believe you were saying something about "best intentions."`,
  `You were gonna shoot him?`,
  `Can I get a pack'a Red Apples?`,
  `No! It's not your fault. You left it at the apartment.`,
  `Fabian my love, our adventure begins.`,
  `Everything looks hunky dorie. Looks can be deceiving, but this time I don't think they are. Why waste the manpower to stake out my place.`,
  `I'd have to be a fuckin' idiot to come back here. That's how you're gonna beat 'em Butch, they keep underestimating you.`,
  `Fuck.`,
  `I'll be a sonofabitch. `,
  `Mia! Mia! What did you take? Answer me honey, what did you take?`,
  `It's cold.`,
  `Sorry 'bout that, Floyd.`,
  `We should be fuckin' dead right now. Did you see that gun he fired at us? It was bigger than him.`,
  `Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm a real good friend. Good friend, bad husband, soon to be ex-husband.`,
  `Who the fuck are you?`,
  `Look, what's your name? I got his name's Vincent, but what's yours?`,
  `You two are a match made in heaven.`,
  `You said you waited for me?`,
  `Tell that bitch to be cool! Say, bitch be cool! Say, bitch be cool!`,
  `Hi. You know, if they ever do "I SPY: THE MOTION PICTURE," you guys, I'd be great. What's with the outfits. You guys going to a volleyball game?`,
  `Down!`,
  `Up!`,
  `He's dead! He's dead!`,
  `Are they having a moment?`,
  `So, we cool Yolanda? We ain't gonna do anything stupid, are we?`,
  `It was good --`,
  `Correct. I got all tonight to quack.`,
  `What?`,
  `Wake up!`,
  `Everybody be cool this is a robbery!`,
  `Okay honey, we're getting you on your feet.`,
  `Hello! I'm here!`,
  `...and ever.`,
  `...and he's...he's...tall --`,
  `...and that's Mamie Van Doren. I don't see Jayne Mansfield, so it must be her night off.`,
  `...Coolidge was out of there faster than I've ever seen a victorious boxer vacate the ring. Do you think he knew Willis was dead?`,
  `...Esmarelda Villalobos -- is that Mexican?`,
  `...ever seen that show "COPS?"`,
  `I was watchin' it once and this cop was on it who was talkin' about this time he got into this gun fight with a guy in a hallway.`,
  `He unloads on this guy and he doesn't hit anything. And these guys were in a hallway. It's a freak, but it happens.`,
  `...goddamn...goddamn...that was fucked up...goddamn, that was cold- blooded...`,
  `...I'll lend it to you. It's a great book on body piercing.`,
  `...it's a moral test of yourself, whether or not you can maintain loyalty. Because when people are loyal to each other, that's very meaningful.`,
  `...three!`,
  `...three.`,
  `...three.`,
  `...two...`,
  `...two...`,
  `...Vincent...Jimmie...Bonnie....`,
  `...well, say she comes home. Whaddya think she'll do? No fuckin' shit she'll freak. That ain't no kinda answer. You know 'er, I don't.`,
  `How bad, a lot or a little?`,
  `...yeah...are you still brushing your teeth?`,
  `A buddy of mine in Toluca Lake.`,
  `A foot massage?`,
  `A husband being protective of his wife is one thing. A husband almost killing another man for touching his wife's feet is something else.`,
  `A lot of people go to restaurants.`,
  `A lot of wallets.`,
  `A motorcycle movie, I'm not sure the name.`,
  `A pot. A pot belly. Pot bellies are sexy.`,
  `A sewer rat may taste like pumpkin pie. I'll never know 'cause even if it did, I wouldn't eat the filthy motherfucker. Pigs sleep and root in shit.`,
  `That's a filthy animal. I don't wanna eat nothin' that ain't got enough sense to disregard its own feces.`,
  `A shake? Milk and ice cream?`,
  `About fifteen hundred dollars.`,
  `About the car, is there anything I need to know? Does it stall, does it make a lot of noise, does it smoke, is there gas in it, anything?`,
  `Actually, there's something I've wanted to ask you about, but you seem like a nice person, and I didn't want to offend you.`,
  `After tonight.`,
  `After what a cool guy I've been, I can't believe you do me like this. It's the only thing I asked.`,
  `All shapes and sizes, Vince.`,
  `All the way?`,
  `Almost nine in the morning. What time does our train arrive?`,
  `Am I a nigger? Are you in Inglewood? No. You're in my house.`,
  `White people who know the difference between good shit and bad shit, this is the house they come to.`,
  `My shit, I'll take the Pepsi Challenge with Amsterdam shit any ol' day of the fuckin' week.`,
  `An act of God.`,
  `And no more liquor stores?`,
  `And you believed that?`,
  `And...?`,
  `Antwan probably didn't expect Marsellus to react like he did, but he had to expect a reaction.`,
  `Any of you fuckin' pricks move and I'll execute every one of you motherfuckers! Got that?`,
  `Any of you fuckin' pricks move and I'll execute every one of you motherfuckers! Got that?!`,
  `Any time of the day is a good time for pie. Blueberry pie to go with the pancakes. And on top, a thin slice of melted cheese --`,
  `Anybody want a beer?`,
  `Are you a "Bewitched" man, or a "Jeannie" man?`,
  `Are you deaf? You're not bringin' that fucked up bitch in my house!`,
  `Are you Jewish?`,
  `Are you mad?`,
  `Are you some kinda weirdo?`,
  `Are you still retiring?`,
  `Are you sure this is absolutely necessary?`,
  `Are you sure?`,
  `Are you watchin' it?`,
  `Aside from how it looks, the car's cool.`,
  `Asking my side.`,
  `At Marsellus' request.`,
  `At the time I was told, it seemed reasonable.`,
  `Baby-love, from the moment I left you, this has been without a doubt the single weirdest day of my entire life. Climb on an' I'll tell ya about it.`,
  `Be my guest.`,
  `Because I'm going back to my apartment to get my watch.`,
  `Because it's a lot of fun.`,
  `Because of the metric system?`,
  `Besides, it's more exciting when you don't have permission.`,
  `Better you than me, gentlemen.`,
  `Betty. I never understood Veronica attraction.`,
  `Big Kahuna Burger.`,
  `Big Kahuna Burger. That's that Hawaiian burger joint. I heard they got some tasty burgers. I ain't never had one myself, how are they?`,
  `Big Mac's a Big Mac, but they call it Le Big Mac.`,
  `Bitch gonna kill more niggers than time.`,
  `Bloody as hell. And to drink, a vanilla coke.`,
  `Blueberry pie.`,
  `Bon soir, Esmarelda.`,
  `Boys, this is Raquel. Someday, all this will be hers.`,
  `Bring out The Gimp.`,
  `But did it happen?`,
  `But I do not speak Spanish.`,
  `But they won't find us, will they?`,
  `But what about all our bags?`,
  `But why?`,
  `But you first.`,
  `Butch, I was so worried!`,
  `Butch, stop watching TV a second. We got a special visitor. Now do you remember when I told you your daddy dies in a P.O.W. camp?`,
  `Butch, whose motorcycle is this?`,
  `Butch.`,
  `Butch.`,
  `Butch.`,
  `Butch. What does it mean?`,
  `Butch?`,
  `Butch? Will you give me oral pleasure?`,
  `Bye.`,
  `Bye-bye, sugar pop.`,
  `Call me Winston.`,
  `Can I have a sip of that? I'd like to know what a five-dollar shake tastes like.`,
  `Can I help you wit' somethin'?`,
  `Can't we just take it to a friendly place?`,
  `'Cause if push met shove, you know I'll take care of business. But push ain't never gonna meet shove. Because You're gonna solve this shit for us.`,
  `You're gonna take our asses outta the cold and bring it inside where it's warm.`,
  `'Cause if I gotta get into it with my friend about his wife over your boy Vincent, I'm gonna have bad feelings.`,
  `'Cause I'm a boxer. And after you've said that, you've said pretty much all there is to say about me.`,
  `Now maybe that son-of-a- bitch tonight was once at one time a boxer. If he was, then he was dead before his ass ever stepped in the ring.`,
  `I just put the poor bastard outta his misery. And if he never was a boxer -- That's what he gets for fuckin' up my sport.`,
  `'Cause storin' dead niggers ain't my fuckin' business!`,
  `Check out the big brain on Brett. You'a smart motherfucker, that's right. The metric system. What's in this?`,
  `Check.`,
  `Cheeseburgers.`,
  `Chill out, honey!`,
  `Chill the fuck out, Jules, this shit happens.`,
  `C'mon Yolanda, what's Fonzie like?`,
  `C'mon, don't be that way.`,
  `C'mon, gentlemen, we're laughin' and jokin' our way into prison. Don't make me beg.`,
  `C'mon, Marvin. Do you think God came down from Heaven and stopped the bullets?`,
  `C'mon, Mr. Wolf....`,
  `Come again?`,
  `Comin' up. I hear you're taking Mia out tomorrow?`,
  `Contre senior Lobo.`,
  `Correct. Just like banks, these places are insured. The managers don't give a fuck.`,
  `they're just tryin' to get ya out the door before you start pluggin' diners. Waitresses, forget it, they ain't takin' a bullet for the register.`,
  `Busboys, some wetback gettin' paid a dollar fifty a hour gonna really give a fuck you're stealin' from the owner.`,
  `Customers are sittin' there with food in their mouths, they don't know what's goin' on.`,
  `One minute they're havin' a Denver omelette, next minute somebody's stickin' a gun in their face.`,
  `Correct-amundo! And that's what we're gonna be, we're gonna be cool.`,
  `Now Ringo, I'm gonna count to three and I want you to let go your gun and lay your palms flat on the table. But when you do it, do it cool. Ready?`,
  `Count to three.`,
  `Counting our guy?`,
  `Customers stay seated, waitresses on the floor.`,
  `Cut. Print. Let's go eat.`,
  `Deal!`,
  `Deal.`,
  `Did everything go as planned?`,
  `Did it work?`,
  `Did they hurt the little girl?`,
  `Did ya think of something to say?`,
  `Did you ever hear the philosophy that once a man admits he's wrong, he's immediately forgiven for all wrong-doings?`,
  `Did you get everything, sugar pop?`,
  `Did you just order a five-dollar shake?`,
  `Die...die...die...die...!`,
  `Die...die...die...die...die...die!`,
  `Do me a favor, will ya? Thought I smelled some coffee in there. Would you make me a cup?`,
  `Do you feel this ring death tragedy will have an effect on the world of boxing?`,
  `Do you have a different idea?`,
  `Do you know that a miracle is?`,
  `Do you know who we are?`,
  `Do you love me?`,
  `Do you remember any of the jokes?`,
  `Do you still want me to go with you?`,
  `Do you wanna continue this theological discussion in the car, or at the jailhouse with the cops?`,
  `Does it have to be exact?`,
  `Does-he-look-like-a-bitch?!`,
  `Donde esta el zapataria?`,
  `Don't be afraid of the soap, spread it around.`,
  `Don't be tellin' me about foot massages -- I'm the fuckin' foot master.`,
  `Don't be. It just means I won't be able to eat breakfast with you.`,
  `Don't blaspheme!`,
  `Don't bring her here! I'm not even fuckin' joking with you, don't you be bringing some fucked up pooh- butt to my house!`,
  `Don't call me retard.`,
  `Don't do shit unless --`,
  `Don't do that! Don't you fuckin' do that! Don't blow this shit off! What just happened was a fuckin' miracle!`,
  `Don't feel bad, sugar pop. Nothing you could ever do would make me permanently angry at you. I love you, remember? Now here's some money, order those pancakes and have a great breakfast.`,
  `Don't go.`,
  `Don't mention it.`,
  `Don't play with me, you said somethin', now what was it?`,
  `Don't take any chances. Execute him!`,
  `Don't worry about it. If Marsellus ever heard of this, I'd be in as much trouble as you.`,
  `Don't worry, I will.`,
  `Don't worry, we're takin' it with us. Jim, the soap.`,
  `Don't yell and me!`,
  `Don't you hate that?`,
  `Don't you love it when you go to the bathroom and you come back to find your food waiting for you?`,
  `Don't you see, Vince, that shit don't matter. You're judging this thing the wrong way. It's not about what.`,
  `It could be God stopped the bullets, he changed Coke into Pepsi, he found my fuckin' car keys. You don't judge shit like this based on merit.`,
  `Whether or not what we experienced was an according-to-Hoyle miracle is insignificant. What is significant is I felt God's touch, God got involved.`,
  `Dorks. They look like a couple of dorks.`,
  `Eleven.`,
  `Emma Peel on "The Avengers." That tough girl who usta hang out with Encyclopedia Brown. And Arlene Motika.`,
  `English-motherfucker-can-you-speak- it?`,
  `Everybody be cool, this is a robbery!`,
  `Everybody just be calm and cooperate with them and this will be all over soon!`,
  `Everybody say Pepsi.`,
  `Examples?`,
  `Excellent pronunciation. You'll be my little mama ceta in no time.`,
  `Expect a call around 10:30. It's about thirty minutes away. I'll be there in ten.`,
  `Fabian, I want you to be with me.`,
  `Fabian, I'm not lying to you, I don't remember.`,
  `Fabian, that was my father's fuckin' watch. You know what my father went through to git me that watch?...`,
  `I don't wanna get into it right now...but he went through a lot.`,
  `Now all this other shit, you coulda set on fire, but I specifically reminded you not to forget my father's watch. Now think, did you get it?`,
  `Fair enough. I drive real fuckin' fast, so keep up. If I get my car back any different than I gave it, Monster Joe's gonna be disposing of two bodies.`,
  `Feel better?`,
  `Filters?`,
  `Fine job, gentlemen. We may get out of this yet.`,
  `Floyd retired too.`,
  `Forever?`,
  `Forget it.`,
  `Forget that gun. That gun goes against the entire idea behind piercing.`,
  `All of my piercing, sixteen places on my body, every one of 'em done with a needle.`,
  `Five in each ear. One through the nipple on my left breast. One through my right nostril. One through my left eyebrow. One through my lip. One in my clit. And I wear a stud in my tongue.`,
  `Forty-five sixty.`,
  `'Fraid I can't do that.`,
  `Friend of yours?`,
  `Fuck the bags. We'll miss our train if we don't split now.`,
  `Fuck you.`,
  `Fuck you.`,
  `Fuckin' A it worked, that's what I'm talkin' about!`,
  `Knucklehead walks in a bank with a telephone, not a pistol, not a shotgun, but a fuckin' phone, cleans the place out, and they don't lift a finger.`,
  `Fuckin' keyed it.`,
  `Funny, I've been thinkin' the same thing.`,
  `Garcon! Coffee!`,
  `Garcon! Coffee!`,
  `Gentlemen, let's get our rules of the road straight. We're going to a place called Monster Joe's Truck and Tow.`,
  `Monster Joe and his daughter Raquel are sympathetic to out dilemma.`,
  `The place is North Hollywood, so a few twist and turns aside, we'll be goin' up Hollywood Way. Now I'll drive the tainted car. Jules, you ride with me.`,
  `Vincent, you follow in my Porsche. Now if we cross the path of any John Q. Laws, nobody does a fuckin' thing 'til I do something. What did I say?`,
  `Get that black box in the bedroom I have with the adrenalin shot.`,
  `Get the fuckin' shot!`,
  `Girl from sixth grade, you don't know her.`,
  `Give me three hundred worth of the madman. If it's as good as you say, I'll be back for a thousand.`,
  `Given a lot of 'em?`,
  `Giving me oral pleasure?`,
  `Go on now, get your ass outta here.`,
  `Goddammit, Jules --`,
  `Goddammit, what is it?`,
  `Goddamn Jimmie, this is some serious gourmet shit. Me an' Vincent woulda been satisfied with freeze-dried Tasters Choice.`,
  `You spring this gourmet fuckin' shit on us. What flavor is this?`,
  `Goddamn!`,
  `Goddamn! That's a pretty fuckin' good milk shake I don't know if it's worth five Handlung dollars, but it's pretty fuckin' good.`,
  `Goddamn, that water's fuckin' cold!`,
  `Good enough, let's go back to the kitchen.`,
  `Good for you. Lighten up a little. You been sittin' there all quiet.`,
  `Good for you. Looks like me and Vincent caught you at breakfast, sorry 'bout that. What'cha eatin'?`,
  `Good job.`,
  `Good, 'cause we got one.`,
  `Good. What I need you two fellas to do is take those cleaning products and clean the inside of the car. And I'm talkin' fast, fast, fast.`,
  `You need to go in the backseat, scoop up all those little pieces of brain and skull. Get it out of there.`,
  `Wipe down the upholstery -- now when it comes to upholstery, it don't need to be spic and span, you don't need to eat off in. Give it a good once over.`,
  `What you need to take care of are the really messy parts. The pools of blood that have collected, you gotta soak that shit up.`,
  `But the windows are a different story.`,
  `Them you really clean. Get the Windex, do a good job. Now Jimmie, we need to raid your linen closet.`,
  `I need blankets, I need comforters, I need quilts, I need bedspreads. The thicker the better, the darker the better. No whites, can't use 'em.`,
  `We need to camouflage the interior of the car. We're gonna line the front seat and the backseat and the floor boards with quilts and blankets.`,
  `If a cop stops us and starts stickin' his big snout in the car, the subterfuge won't last. But at a glance, the car will appear to be normal.`,
  `Jimmie -- lead the way, boys -- get to work.`,
  `Goodbye, Raquel.`,
  `Got it.`,
  `Got it.`,
  `Got it.`,
  `Guilty.`,
  `Ha ha ha. They're your clothes, motherfucker.`,
  `Hamburgers.`,
  `Hamburgers. The cornerstone of any nutritious breakfast. What kinda hamburgers?`,
  `Hand back for a second or two, and when you see the white boy leave, go on over. In the meanwhile, can I make you an espresso?`,
  `Handlung`,
  `Have you ever fantasized about being beaten up by a girl?`,
  `Have you ever given a foot massage?`,
  `Have you ever given a guy a foot massage?`,
  `Have you looked?`,
  `Have you lost your mind?! You crashed your car in my fuckin' house! You talk about drug shit on a cellular fuckin' phone --`,
  `Have you met Mia?`,
  `He booked.`,
  `He fell out of a window.`,
  `He gave her a foot massage.`,
  `Hello, Boyfriend!`,
  `Hello, Girlfriend. I swear, heartbreaker, Joe should change the name of this place to Beauty and the Beast Truck and Tow.`,
  `Hello, little man. Boy I sure heard a bunch about you. See, I was a good friend of your Daddy's.`,
  `We were in that Hanoi pit of hell over five years together.`,
  `Hopefully, you'll never have to experience this yourself, but when two men are in a situation like me and your Daddy were, for as long as we were, you take on certain responsibilities of the other.`,
  `If it had been me who had not made it, Major Coolidge would be talkin' right now to my son Jim.`,
  `But the way it worked out is I'm talkin' to you, Butch. I got somethin' for ya.`,
  `Here?`,
  `Here? It's a coffee shop.`,
  `He's dead?`,
  `He's over there, finishing up some business.`,
  `Hey hillbilly.`,
  `Hey kids.`,
  `Hey man, as far as I know, the motherfucker's tip-top.`,
  `Hey, how do I open the window back here?`,
  `Hey, is Grace gonna be okay in front of this place?`,
  `Hey, mister?`,
  `Hi I'm Buddy, what can I get'cha?`,
  `Hi Vincent, I'm getting dressed. The door's open. Come inside and make yourself a drink.`,
  `Hold hands, you love birds.`,
  `Hold on.`,
  `Honey, grab your radio and your purse and let's go!`,
  `Honey, we gotta hit the fuckin' road!`,
  `How about dogs? Dogs eat their own feces.`,
  `How 'bout a cup of just plain ol' American?`,
  `How 'bout an upgrade, you dispose a whole body for the price of a body part.`,
  `How 'bout you, Peggy Sue?`,
  `How did Marsellus and her meet?`,
  `How d'ya want it, burnt to a crisp, or bloody as hell?`,
  `How d'ya want that shake, Martin and Lewis, or Amos and Andy?`,
  `How long do you intend to walk the earth?`,
  `How many up there?`,
  `How many?`,
  `How should I know, you were the one watchin' it.`,
  `How you boys doin'?`,
  `Huhng?`,
  `Hurry up man! We're losin' her!`,
  `I ain't fer sure yet.`,
  `I ain't fuckin' sayin' Pepsi.`,
  `I ain't gonna do this. This is a punchy move and I ain't punchy! Daddy would totally fuckin' understand.`,
  `If he was here right now, he'd say, "Butch, git a grip. It's a fuckin' watch, man. You lose one, ya git another.`,
  `This is your life you're fuckin' around with, which you shouldn't be doin' 'cause you only got one.`,
  `I ain't hungry.`,
  `I ain't Jewish man, I just don't dig on swine.`,
  `I ain't no model.`,
  `I ain't your friend, palooka.`,
  `I am, if you'll let me.`,
  `I apologize for bein' in your shit like I was.`,
  `I believe so....`,
  `I can dig it.`,
  `I can't believe that's the same car.`,
  `I can't wait.`,
  `I did.`,
  `I didn't call you a Mongoloid, I called you a retard, but I took it back.`,
  `I didn't hear you.`,
  `I didn't mean to do it. I said it was an accident.`,
  `I didn't realize there was a difference between a tummy and a pot belly.`,
  `I didn't say shit. Let's go to work.`,
  `I don't eat dog either.`,
  `I don't even have an opinion.`,
  `I don't feel the least little bit bad. You wanna know why, Esmarelda?`,
  `I don't give a damn if he does.`,
  `I don't give a damn what men find attractive. It's unfortunate what we find pleasing to the touch and pleasing to the eye is seldom the same.`,
  `I don't know what that was. Music and drinks!`,
  `I don't know you, who is this, don't come here, I'm hangin' up.`,
  `I don't know! Stop bothering me!`,
  `I don't know, Honey Bunny. He looks like the hero type to me!`,
  `I don't know.`,
  `I don't know. I couldn't understand you.`,
  `I don't know. There probably never was a little girl -- the point of the story isn't the little girl. The point of the story is they robbed the bank with a telephone.`,
  `I don't like this photograph shit.`,
  `I don't mean any disrespect. I just don't like people barkin' orders at me.`,
  `I don't mean to shatter your ego, but this ain't the first time I've had gun pointed at me.`,
  `I don't smile in pictures.`,
  `I don't talk in my sleep, do I talk in my sleep?`,
  `I don't think we're there yet. But don't feel bad, we just met each other.`,
  `I don't understand --`,
  `I don't understand --`,
  `I don't wanna hear about no motherfuckin' "ifs." What I wanna hear from your ass is: "you ain't got no problems, Jules. I'm on the motherfucker.`,
  `Go back in there, chill them niggers out and wait for the cavalry, which should be comin' directly."`,
  `I don't wanna kill anybody either. But they'll probably put us in a situation where it's us of them.`,
  `And if it's not the gooks, it these old Jews who've owned the store for fifteen fuckin' generations.`,
  `Ya got Grandpa Irving sittin' behind the counter with a fuckin' Magnum.`,
  `Try walkin' into one of those stores with nothin' but a telephone, see how far it gets you. Fuck it, forget it, we're out of it.`,
  `I don't want to be a burden or a nuisance --`,
  `I don't watch TV.`,
  `I dunno, however people meet people. She usta be an actress.`,
  `I dunno, I didn't go into a Burger King. But you know what they put on french fries in Holland instead of ketchup?`,
  `I dunno, some medical book.`,
  `I get the "I'm with Stupid" shirt.`,
  `I got a threshold, Jules. I got a threshold for the abuse I'll take. And you're crossin' it. I'm a race car and you got me in the red.`,
  `Redline 7000, that's where you are. Just know, it's fuckin' dangerous to be drivin' a race car when it's in the red. It could blow.`,
  `I got no problem with that.`,
  `I gotta go pee! I want to go home.`,
  `I gotta stab her?`,
  `I gotta take a shit. To be continued.`,
  `I guess it's when God makes the impossible possible. And I'm sorry Jules, but I don't think what happened this morning qualifies.`,
  `I guess you just gotta know how to wear them.`,
  `I guess.`,
  `I have character.`,
  `I have moments.`,
  `I have to do it.`,
  `I haven't seen you in a long time. I miss you, we're going to breakfast. So it is written, so shall it be done.`,
  `I just accidentally shot Marvin in the throat.`,
  `I just been sittin' here thinkin'.`,
  `I just hope I still have it. Whaddya think of Trudi? She ain't got a boyfriend, wanna hand out an' get high?`,
  `I just want you to know how sorry we are about how fucked up things got between us and Mr. Wallace.`,
  `When we entered into this thing, we only had the best intentions --`,
  `I just wish I caught 'em doin' it, ya know? Oh man, I'd give anything to catch 'em doin' it.`,
  `It'a been worth his doin' it, if I coulda just caught 'em, you know what I mean?`,
  `I knew you could. First question, Brady Bunch or the Partridge Family?`,
  `I know that's what I always say. I'm always right too, but --`,
  `I love you, Honey Bunny.`,
  `I love you, Pumpkin.`,
  `I mean the way it is now, you're takin' the same fuckin' risk as when you rob a bank. You take more of a risk. Banks are easier!`,
  `Federal banks aren't supposed to stop you anyway, during a robbery. They're insured, why should they care? You don't even need a gun in a federal bank.`,
  `I heard about this guy, walked into a federal bank with a portable phone, handed the phone to the teller, the guy on the other end of the phone said:`,
  `"We got this guy's little girl, and if you don't give him all your money, we're gonna kill 'er."`,
  `I meant I wouldn't laugh at you.`,
  `I meant what now, between me and you?`,
  `I might've broke my nose, no biggie. Hop on.`,
  `I need a big fat magic marker, any felt pen'll do, but a magic marker would be great.`,
  `I need a big fat magic marker, got one?`,
  `I need it man, I got a chick she's fuckin' O.D.ing on me.`,
  `I never had to use it. I don't go joy-poppin' with bubble-gummers, all of my friends can handle their highs!`,
  `I never listen to your fights. Were you the winner?`,
  `I never saw a medical book.`,
  `I promise.`,
  `I remember him.`,
  `I said a "please" would be nice.`,
  `I seen 'em do it. And I don't mean a little bit on the side of the plate, they fuckin' drown 'em in it.`,
  `I seriously doubt that.`,
  `I sound like a sensible fucking man, is what I sound like.`,
  `I think her biggest deal was she starred in a pilot.`,
  `I think I cracked a rib.`,
  `I think I know who you mean, what about him?`,
  `I think The Gimp's asleep.`,
  `I think we oughta leave now.`,
  `I think we should be going now.`,
  `I think ya heard me just fine, punchy.`,
  `I think you're gonna find -- when all this shit is over and done -- I think you're gonna find yourself one smilin' motherfucker.`,
  `Thing is Butch, right now you got ability. But painful as it may be, ability don't last.`,
  `Now that's a hard motherfuckin' fact of life, but it's a fact of life your ass is gonna hafta git realistic about.`,
  `This business is filled to the brim with unrealistic motherfuckers who thought their ass aged like wine.`,
  `Besides, even if you went all the way, what would you be? Feather- weight champion of the world.`,
  `Who gives a shit? I doubt you can even get a credit card based on that.`,
  `I think you're taking me out to breakfast.`,
  `I thought so. Well, you remember your business partner Marsellus Wallace, dont'ya Brett?`,
  `I thought you told those fuckin' assholes never to call this late!`,
  `I used the same soap you did and when I dried my hands, the towel didn't look like a fuckin' Maxie pad. Look, fuck it, alright. Who cares?`,
  `But it's shit like this that's gonna bring this situation to a boil. If he were to come in here and see that towel like that...`,
  `I'm tellin' you Vincent, you best be cool. 'Cause if I gotta get in to it with Jimmie on account of you....`,
  `Look, I ain't threatenin' you, I respect you an' all, just don't put me in that position.`,
  `I wanna dance.`,
  `I want to convey Mr. Wallace's gratitude with the help you're providing on this matter.`,
  `Let me assure you Jimmie, Mr. Wallace's gratitude is worth having.`,
  `I want to know what it feels like to kill a man --`,
  `I want you to repeat what you said.`,
  `I was a pleasure watchin' you work.`,
  `I was just dryin' my hands.`,
  `I was led to believe if she comes home and finds us here, she wouldn't appreciate it none too much.`,
  `I was looking at myself in the mirror.`,
  `I washed 'em. Blood's real hard to get off. Maybe if he had some Lava, I coulda done a better job.`,
  `I watched you get 'em wet.`,
  `I will never forgive your ass for this shit. This is some fucked-up repugnant shit!`,
  `I wish I had a pot.`,
  `I won alright.`,
  `I would think by now I've earned the equivalent of Frequent Flyer miles.`,
  `I wouldn't go so far as to call a dog filthy, but they're definitely dirty. But a dog's got personality. And personality goes a long way.`,
  `I wouldn't go so far as to call the brother fat. He's got a weight problem. What's the nigger gonna do, he's Samoan.`,
  `I'd smother you. I'd drop it on your right on your face 'til you couldn't breathe.`,
  `If he kicks us out, whadda we do?`,
  `If I had a pot belly, I'd punch you in it.`,
  `If I'm curt with you, it's because time is a factor. I think fast, I talk fast, and I need you guys to act fast if you want to get out of this.`,
  `So pretty please, with sugar on top, clean the fuckin' car.`,
  `If it takes forever, I'll wait forever.`,
  `If the price of that favor is I gotta take shit, he can stick his favor straight up his ass.`,
  `If they find us, they'll kill us, won't they?`,
  `If you can keep a secret, so can I.`,
  `If you did leave it at the apartment, it's not your fault. I had you bring a bunch of stuff.`,
  `I reminded you about it, but I didn't illustrate how personal the watch was to me. If all I gave a fuck about was my watch, I should've told you.`,
  `You ain't a mind reader.`,
  `If you find my answers frightening, Vincent, you should cease askin' scary questions.`,
  `If you need a witness in court, I'll be glad to help. He was a drunken maniac. He hit you and crashed into that car.`,
  `If you wanna play blind man, then go walk with a Shepherd. But me, my eyes are wide fuckin' open.`,
  `If you want the needle to pierce through to her heart, you gotta stab her hard. Then once you do, push down on the plunger.`,
  `If you were "Archie," who would you fuck first, Betty or Veronica?`,
  `If you'll excuse me, I gotta go home and have a heart attack.`,
  `If you're okay, say something.`,
  `If you're the cab I called, I'm the guy you're supposed to pick up.`,
  `If you're through havin' your little hissy fit, this chick is dyin', get your needle and git it now!`,
  `I'll be back before you can say, blueberry pie.`,
  `I'll bet ya ten thousand dollars, he laughs his ass off.`,
  `I'll do that.`,
  `I'll have the Douglas Sirk steak.`,
  `I'll have the Durwood Kirby burger -- bloody -- and a five-dollar shake.`,
  `I'll just be Jules, Vincent -- no more, no less.`,
  `I'll see you two around, and stay outta trouble, you crazy kids.`,
  `I'll take care of it.`,
  `I'll tell ya what, if you ever need it, I'll dispose of a body part for free.`,
  `I'm an American, our names don't mean shit. Anyway, moving right along, what is it you wanna know, Esmarelda?`,
  `I'm Brett.`,
  `I'm cool, Mr. Wolf. My gun just went off, I dunno how.`,
  `I'm countin' to three, and if your hand ain't off that case, I'm gonna unload right in your fuckin' face. Clear? One...`,
  `I'm curious about that myself.`,
  `I'm doin' fine. Handlung`,
  `I'm gonna be okay.`,
  `I'm gonna order a big plate of blueberry pancakes with maple syrup, eggs over easy, and five sausages.`,
  `I'm gonna take a piss.`,
  `I'm gonna take your Honda.`,
  `I'm not a cobb or corn, so you can stop butterin' me up. I don't need you to tell me how good my coffee is.`,
  `I'm the one who buys it, I know how fuckin' good it is. When Bonnie goes shoppin;, she buys shit.`,
  `I buy the gourmet expensive stuff 'cause when I drink it, I wanna taste it.`,
  `But what's on my mind at this moment isn't the coffee in my kitchen, it's the dead nigger in my garage.`,
  `I'm not fuckin' stoppin' you.`,
  `I'm not gonna be a bad boy.`,
  `I'm not gonna kill anybody.`,
  `I'm not much of a dancer.`,
  `I'm not sayin' he was right, but you're sayin' a foot massage don't mean nothing, and I'm sayin' it does.`,
  `I've given a million ladies a million foot massages and they all meant somethin'. We act like they don't, but they do.`,
  `That's what's so fuckin' cool about 'em. This sensual thing's goin' on that nobody's talkin about, but you know it and she knows it, fuckin' Marsellus knew it, and Antwan shoulda known fuckin' better.`,
  `That's his fuckin' wife, man. He ain't gonna have a sense of humor about that shit.`,
  `I'm not sayin' I wanna rob banks, I'm just illustrating that if we did, it would be easier than what we been doin'.`,
  `I'm not sure yet. Wherever you want. We're gonna get a lot of money from this.`,
  `But it ain't gonna be so much, we can live like hogs in the fat house forever.`,
  `I was thinking we could go somewhere in the South Pacific. The kinda money we'll have'll carry us a long way down there.`,
  `I'm not sure.`,
  `I'm on my way somewhere. I got a dinner engagement. Rain check?`,
  `I'm prepared to scour the earth for this motherfucker. If Butch goes to Indo China, I want a nigger hidin' in a bowl of rice, ready to pop a cap in his ass.`,
  `I'm ready.`,
  `I'm sorry I worried you, sweetie. Everything's fine. Hey, how was breakfast?`,
  `I'm sorry, baby-love.`,
  `I'm sorry.`,
  `I'm takin' m'lady out to breakfast. Maybe I can drop you two off. Where do you live?`,
  `I'm tellin' Marsellus today I'm through.`,
  `I'm the manager here, there's no problem, no problem at all --`,
  `I'm Vincent, you Mia?`,
  `I'm Vincent. And Jimmie, thank a bunch,`,
  `In a way. Why? Would you like for me to switch it off?`,
  `In the bag.`,
  `In the fifth, my ass goes down.`,
  `In the fifth, your ass goes down.`,
  `Inglewood.`,
  `Is everything well? Are we in danger?`,
  `Is that a fact?`,
  `Is that a fact?`,
  `Is that better, sugar pop?`,
  `It ain't a date. It's like when you and your buddy's wife go to a movie or somethin'. It's just... you know...good company.`,
  `It ain't no ballpark either.`,
  `Look maybe your method of massage differs from mine, but touchin' his lady's feet, and stickin' your tongue in her holyiest of holyies, ain't the same ballpark, ain't the same league, ain't even the same fuckin' sport.`,
  `Foot massages don't mean shit.`,
  `It ain't quite time, let's hang back.`,
  `It ain't that way, Mr. Wolf. Your help is definitely appreciated.`,
  `It costs five dollars?`,
  `It mean "Esmarelda of the wolves."`,
  `It was a foot massage, a foot massage is nothing, I give my mother a foot massage.`,
  `It was show about a team of female secret agents called "Fox Force Five."`,
  `It won't take a second.`,
  `It's a chopper.`,
  `It's a little too early in the morning for explosions and war.`,
  `It's a sex thing. It helps fellatio.`,
  `It's a very pretty name.`,
  `It's all yours, Ringo.`,
  `It's beautiful.`,
  `It's chicken shit. You don't fuck another man's vehicle.`,
  `It's cool, Honey Bunny, we're still cool.`,
  `It's cool, Vincent! It's cool! Don't do a goddamn thing. Yolanda, it's cool baby, nothin's changed.`,
  `We're still just talkin', Tell her we're still cool.`,
  `It's just tobacco.`,
  `It's laying hands on Marsellus Wallace's new wife in a familiar way. Is it as bad as eatin' her out -- no, but you're in the same fuckin' ballpark.`,
  `It's like a wax museum with a pulse rate.`,
  `It's not a date.`,
  `It's only one-thirty in the goddamn mornin'! What the fuck's goin' on out here?`,
  `It's possible.`,
  `It's ready, I'll tell you what to do.`,
  `It's the little differences. A lotta the same shit we got here, they got there, but there they're a little different.`,
  `It's the one that says Bad Motherfucker on it.`,
  `It's there.`,
  `It's time, Butch.`,
  `It's under the be --`,
  `It's under the bed.`,
  `I've grasped that, Jules. All I'm doin' is contemplating the "ifs."`,
  `I've never does this before either, and I ain't starting now. You brought 'er here, that means you give her the shot.`,
  `The day I bring an O.D.ing bitch to your place, then I gotta give her the shot.`,
  `I've never does this before.`,
  `I've said it before, I'll say it again, your business is always welcome.`,
  `I've seen a lot of crazy-ass shit in my time --`,
  `Jesus Christ Almighty!`,
  `Jesus Christ!`,
  `Jesus Christ!`,
  `Jesus, are you okay?`,
  `Jimmie --`,
  `Jimmie --`,
  `Jimmie, have you forgotten about your wife comin' home?`,
  `Jimmie?`,
  `Jules, if you give this nimrod fifteen hundred buck, I'm gonna shoot 'em on general principle.`,
  `Jules, you ask me nice like that, no problem. He's your friend, you handle him.`,
  `Just because you are a character doesn't mean you have character.`,
  `Just checking.`,
  `Just chill out.`,
  `Just hang in there, baby, you're doing' great, Ringo's proud of you and so am I. It's almost over, Now I want you to go in that bag and find my wallet.`,
  `Just tell 'im not to be abusive. He kinda freaked out back there when he saw Marvin.`,
  `Keep an eye on this one.`,
  `Keep the light off.`,
  `Keep your fuckin' mouth closed, fat man, this ain't any of your goddamn business!`,
  `Killing a man. Beating another man to death with your bare hands.`,
  `Knives. The character I played, Raven McCoy, her background was she was raised by circus performers. So she grew up doing a knife act.`,
  `According to the show, she was the deadliest woman in the world with a knife.`,
  `But because she grew up in a circus, she was also something of an acrobat.`,
  `She could do illusions, she was a trapeze artist -- when you're keeping the world safe from evil, you never know when being a trapeze artist's gonna come in handy.`,
  `And she knew a zillion old jokes her grandfather, an old vaudevillian, taught her.`,
  `If we woulda got picked up, they woulda worked in a gimmick where every episode I woulda told and ol joke.`,
  `Knock it off, Julie.`,
  `Kooties I can handle.`,
  `Lance! The phone's ringing!`,
  `Lance, this is Vincent, I'm in big fuckin' trouble man, I'm on my way to your place.`,
  `Let him go!`,
  `Let him go! Let him go! I'll blow your fuckin' head off! I'll kill ya! I'll kill ya! You're gonna die, you're gonna fuckin' die bad!`,
  `Let me help you Bashful, did it involve the F-word?`,
  `Let us speak of the unspeakable.`,
  `Let's move.`,
  `Let's shake on it.`,
  `Like a couple of guys who just blew off somebody's head. Yes, strippin' off those bloody rags is absolutely necessary.`,
  `Toss the clothes in Jim's garbage bag.`,
  `Like it never happened.`,
  `Look at this mess! We're drivin' around on a city street in broad daylight --`,
  `Look mister, this ain't any of your business --`,
  `Look my friend, this is just where me and you differ --`,
  `Look! I didn't mean to shoot this son-of-a-bitch, the gun just went off, don't ask me how! Now I think the humane thing to do is put him out of his misery.`,
  `Look, I'm not a idiot. She's the big man's fuckin' wife. I'm gonna sit across a table, chew my food with my mouth closed, laugh at her jokes and that's all I'm gonna do.`,
  `Look, just because I wouldn't give no man a foot massage, don't make it right for Marsellus to throw Antwan off a building into a glass- motherfuckin-house, fuckin' up the way the nigger talks.`,
  `That ain't right, man. Motherfucker do that to me, he better paralyze my ass, 'cause I'd kill'a motherfucker.`,
  `Look, just keep talkin' to her, okay? While she's gettin' the shot, I gotta get a medical book.`,
  `Lookin' at somethin', friend?`,
  `Looks like we got a vigilante in our midst.`,
  `Lotsa cream, lotsa sugar.`,
  `Man, get outta my face with that shit! The motherfucker who said that never had to pick up itty- bitty pieces of skull with his fingers on account of your dumb ass.`,
  `Man, you best back off, I'm gittin' pissed -- this is the door.`,
  `Marsellus said you just got back from Amsterdam.`,
  `Marsellus throwing Tony out of a four-story window for giving me a foot massage seemed reasonable?`,
  `Martin and Lewis.`,
  `Marvin, I just wanna apologize. I got nothin' to do with this shit. And I want you to know I think it's fucked up.`,
  `Marvin, I'd knock that shit off if I was you.`,
  `Marvin, what do you make of all this?`,
  `Mayonnaise.`,
  `Me casa, su casa.`,
  `Merci beaucoup.`,
  `Merci beaucoup. And here's a little something for the effort.`,
  `Merde! You startled me. Did you have a bad dream?`,
  `Mia!`,
  `Mia.`,
  `Mia. Why you so interested in big man's wife?`,
  `Mind if I try one of yours?`,
  `Most definitely.`,
  `Mr. Wolf, you gotta understand somethin' --`,
  `Mr. Wolf.`,
  `Mucho gracias.`,
  `Mum's the word.`,
  `My black fuckin' medical book. It's like a text book they give to nurses.`,
  `My black medical book!`,
  `My boss' dirty laundry.`,
  `My darling, I don't want you to be murdered over a silly watch.`,
  `My guess would be yes, Richard. I could see from my position here, the frenzy in his eyes give way to the realization of what he was doing.`,
  `I think any man would've left the ring that fast.`,
  `My name's Paul, and this is between y'all.`,
  `My name's Pitt, and you ain't talkin' your ass outta this shit.`,
  `Naw man. I'm pretty fuckin' far from okay!`,
  `Naw, all those guys are goin' down the same road, either dead or servin' twenty.`,
  `Naw, drag big boy to Russell's old room.`,
  `Naw, I don't eat pork.`,
  `Negative.`,
  `Nick Nolte, of course.`,
  `No and, that's it.`,
  `No choice.`,
  `No c'mon, you're him, I know you're him, tell me you're him.`,
  `No it's not, it's just what I heard.`,
  `No Jules, you're gonna be like those pieces of shit out there who beg for change.`,
  `They walk around like a bunch of fuckin' zombies, they sleep in garbage bins, they eat what I throw away, and dogs piss on 'em.`,
  `They got a word for 'em, they're called bums. And without a job, residence, or legal tender, that's what you're gonna be -- a fuckin' bum!`,
  `No no no no no no no, nothin' that bad.`,
  `No problem?`,
  `No retard, from the fight.`,
  `No there's not.`,
  `No, forget it, it's too risky. I'm through doin' that shit.`,
  `No, I mean where did you get'em? MacDonald's, Wendy's, Jack-in-the- Box, where?`,
  `No, I'm not. I'm not gonna give you any problem!`,
  `No, imbecile, what was your dream about?`,
  `No, it seemed excessive. But that doesn't mean it didn't happen. I heard Marsellus is very protective of you.`,
  `No, it's a subject I have much interest in. You are the first person I ever met who has killed somebody. So, what was it like to kill a man?`,
  `No, it's not. It's not here.`,
  `No, it's Thursday.`,
  `No, that's Jody. That's my wife.`,
  `No, they didn't have blueberry pancakes, I had to get buttermilk -- are you sure you're okay?`,
  `No, they got the metric system there, they wouldn't know what the fuck a Quarter Pounder is.`,
  `No, you're gonna give her the shot.`,
  `No.`,
  `No.`,
  `No.`,
  `No.`,
  `No. It's really corny.`,
  `No. Pot bellies make a man look either oafish, or like a gorilla. But on a woman, a pot belly is very sexy. The rest of you is normal.`,
  `Normal face, normal legs, normal hips, normal ass, but with a big, perfectly round pot belly.`,
  `If I had one, I'd wear a tee-shirt two sizes too small to accentuate it.`,
  `No. They just said Rocky Horror gave you a foot massage.`,
  `No. You won't like it and I'll be embarrassed.`,
  `Nobody kills anybody in my place of business except me or Zed.`,
  `Nobody's gonna hurt anybody. We're gonna be like three Fonzies. And what' Fonzie like?`,
  `Non.`,
  `Nope.`,
  `Not a goddamn thing.`,
  `Not at all. Being the subject of back-fence gossip goes with the right, I guess.`,
  `Not no more.`,
  `Not regularly.`,
  `Not that! Take her out. Show her a good time. Don't let her get lonely.`,
  `Not the same thing, the same ballpark.`,
  `Not yet.`,
  `Not yet. I'm going to interview you first. Are you any relation to Suzanne Vega?`,
  `Nothin' I can't handle. I want you to just hang back and don't do shit unless it's absolutely necessary.`,
  `Nothin'. Let's get into character.`,
  `Now business is done, it's time for pleasure.`,
  `Now describe to me what Marsellus Wallace looks like!`,
  `Now describe what Marsellus Wallace looks like!`,
  `Now if anybody should ask you about who your fare was tonight, what're you gonna tell 'em?`,
  `Now I'm gonna ask you a bunch of quick questions I've come up with that more of less tell me what kind of person I'm having dinner with.`,
  `My theory is that when it comes to important subjects, there's only two ways a person can answer.`,
  `For instance, there's two kinds of people in this world, Elvis people and Beatles people. Now Beatles people can like Elvis.`,
  `And Elvis people can like the Beatles. But nobody likes them both equally. Somewhere you have to make a choice. And that choice tells me who you are.`,
  `Now I'm the one gettin' gyped. I do believe Marsellus told you to take me out and do whatever I wanted. Well, now I want to dance.`,
  `Now Jimmie, don't do nothin' stupid like puttin' that out in front of your house for Elmo the garbage man to take away.`,
  `Now mean fuckin' now! Do it or die, do it or fucking die!`,
  `Now the night of the fight, you may fell a slight sting, that's pride fuckin' wit ya. Fuck pride! Pride only hurts, it never helps.`,
  `Fight through that shit. 'Cause a year from now, when you're kickin' it in the Caribbean you're gonna say, "Marsellus Wallace was right."`,
  `Now this is Panda, from Mexico. Very good stuff. This is Bava, different, but equally good. And this is Choco from the Hartz Mountains of Germany.`,
  `Now the first two are the same, forty-five an ounce -- those are friend prices -- but this one...this one's a little more expensive. It's fifty-five.`,
  `But when you shoot it, you'll know where that extra money went. Nothing wrong with the first two. It's real, real, real, good shit.`,
  `But this one's a fuckin' madman.`,
  `Now you just wait one goddamn minute --`,
  `Now you on top, stand up and come to the counter.`,
  `Oak's nice.`,
  `Of all the fuckin' things she coulda forgot, she forgets my father's watch. I specifically reminded her not to forget it.`,
  `"Bedside table -- on the kangaroo." I said the words: "Don't forget my father's watch."`,
  `Oh Dan, a tragedy like this can't help but shake the world of boxing to its very foundation.`,
  `But it's of paramount importance that during the sad weeks ahead, the eyes of the W.B.A. remain firmly fixed on the -- CLICK --`,
  `Oh I like that, I like being called a tulip. Tulip is much better than Mongoloid.`,
  `Oh it most definitely should be here, but it's not. So where is it?`,
  `Oh man, that's fucked up.`,
  `Oh my God, I've been shot!`,
  `Oh yes, thank you.`,
  `Oh you're so funny, oh you're so funny.`,
  `Oh, I...don't remember. It's really rare I remember a dream.`,
  `Oh, that what now? Well, let me tell ya what now between me an' you. There is no me an' you. Not no more.`,
  `Oh. Well in that case, will you roll me one, cowboy?`,
  `Okay fellas, in the one-size-fits- all category, we got swim trunks, one red -- one white.`,
  `And two extra-large tee-shirts. A UC Santa Cruz shirt and an "I'm with Stupid" shirt.`,
  `Okay first thing, you two. Take the body, stick it in the trunk. Now Jimmie, this looks to be a pretty domesticated house.`,
  `That would lead me to believe that in the garage or under the sink, you got a bunch of cleaners and cleaners and shit like that, am I correct?`,
  `Okay gentlemen, you're both been to County before, I'm sure. Here it comes.`,
  `Okay man, it was a miracle, can we leave now?`,
  `Okay people, I'm going to go 'round and collect your wallets. Don't talk, just toss 'em in the bag. We clear?`,
  `Okay Winston, get in there.`,
  `Okay, now let him go!`,
  `Okay, one photo and we go.`,
  `Okay, Pontius Pilot, when I count three, honk your horn. One... two...`,
  `Okay, sorry, sorry, sorry, I take it back! Can I have a towel please, Miss Beautiful Tulip.`,
  `Okay, what do I do?`,
  `Okay, you guys put your arms around each other.`,
  `Okay.`,
  `Okay.`,
  `Okay.`,
  `On "Rich Man, Poor Man," who did you like, Peter Strauss or Nick Nolte?`,
  `On the floor or I'll cook you ass, comprende?`,
  `On the other side of the hill, by Burbank Studios. If Jimmie's ass ain't home, I don't know what the fuck we're gonna go.`,
  `I ain't got any other partners in 818. Jimmie! How you doin' man, it's Jules. Listen up man, me an' my homeboy are in some serious shit.`,
  `We're in a car we gotta get off the road, pronto! I need to use your garage for a couple hours.`,
  `Jimmie, you know I can't get into this shit on a cellular fuckin' phone.`,
  `But what I can say is my ass is out in the cold and I'm askin' you for some sanctuary 'til our people can bring us in. I appreciate this, man `,
  `We'll be gone by then. -- Jimmie, I'm aware of your situation. I ain't gonna fuck things up for you.`,
  `I give you my word, partner, she'll never know we were there. Five minutes. Later.`,
  `One drink and leave. Don't be rude, but drink your drink quickly, say goodbye, walk out the door, get in your car, and go down the road.`,
  `One more kiss and I'll get up.`,
  `One, it's not a silly watch. Two, I'm not gonna be murdered. And three, don't be scared.`,
  `I won't let anything get in the way of us living a happy life together.`,
  `One...`,
  `One...two...three.`,
  `Only if you promise not to get offended.`,
  `Oooohhhh, this doesn't sound like mindless, boring, getting-to-know- you chit-chat. This sounds like you actually have something to say.`,
  `Open it up.`,
  `Open it.`,
  `Oui.`,
  `Oui. Hard day at the office?`,
  `Out in the yard, up to no good.`,
  `Outta here.`,
  `Pack of Red Apples, dollar-forty.`,
  `Perfect. Perfect. We couldn't've planned this better. You guys look like...what do they look like, Jimmie?`,
  `Pie for breakfast?`,
  `Please do.`,
  `Please don't! I'm not a hero. I'm just a coffee shop manager. Take anything you want.`,
  `Poor baby. Can we make spoons?`,
  `Positive? Don't get me out on the road and I find out the brake lights don't work.`,
  `Possibility exists, but unlikely.`,
  `Pretty hard. I got into a fight.`,
  `Pretty smart, huh?`,
  `Pretty smart.`,
  `Pretty smart. I'm ready, let's go, right here, right now.`,
  `Promise her.`,
  `Put it in your pocket, it's yours. Now with the rest of them wallets and the register, that makes this a pretty successful little score.`,
  `Put yourself in his position. It's eight o'clock in the morning. He just woke up, he wasn't prepared for this shit.`,
  `Don't forget who's doin' who a favor.`,
  `Que hora es?`,
  `Que hora es?`,
  `Quickly gentlemen, we got about fifteen minutes before Jimmie's better-half comes pulling into the driveway.`,
  `Quit fuckin' around man and give her the shot!`,
  `Raquel --`,
  `Raquel, I been up all night. I need sleep. You understand the concept of sleep?`,
  `Ready to go?`,
  `Redondo Beach.`,
  `Remember, I just got back from Amsterdam.`,
  `Remember, same as before, you're crowd control, I handle the employees.`,
  `Right in the belly.`,
  `Rollin' a smoke.`,
  `Royale with Cheese, you know why they call it that?`,
  `Royale with Cheese.`,
  `Royale with Cheese.`,
  `Sacre bleu.`,
  `Satisfied?`,
  `Sausages taste good. Pork chops taste good.`,
  `Say "What" again! C'mon, say "What" again! I dare ya, I double dare ya motherfucker, say "What" one more goddamn time!`,
  `Say it!`,
  `Say it!`,
  `See ya 'round, Vince.`,
  `See, I got the idea last liquor store we stuck up. 'Member all those customers kept comin' in?`,
  `Sent a couple of guys over to his place. They took him out on the patio of his apartment, threw his ass over the balcony. Nigger fell four stories.`,
  `They had this garden at the bottom, enclosed in glass, like one of them greenhouses -- nigger fell through that.`,
  `Since then, he's kinda developed a speech impediment.`,
  `Set is straight, Buster. I'm not here to say "please." I'm here to tell you want to do.`,
  `And if self- preservation is an instinct you possess, you better fuckin' do it and do it quick. I'm here to help.`,
  `If my help's not appreciated, lotsa luck gentlemen.`,
  `She ain't my fuckin' problem, you fucked her up, you deal with it -- are you talkin' to me on a cellular phone?`,
  `She ever do anything I woulda saw?`,
  `She shot me! I'm dying! Sally! Sally!`,
  `She's O.D.in'?`,
  `She's O.D.ing on us.`,
  `She's supposed to come out of it like that.`,
  `Shit Negro, that's all you had to say.`,
  `Shit yeah. I got my technique down man, I don't tickle or nothin'.`,
  `Shoot 'em in the face!`,
  `Shut up fuck head! I hate that Mongoloid voice.`,
  `Shut up!`,
  `Shut up, Fatso! I don't have a pot! I have a bit of a tummy, like Madonna when she did "Lucky Star," it's not the same thing.`,
  `Smile, Winston.`,
  `Smile, you're on Mia's camera!`,
  `So by that rationale, if a pig had a better personality, he's cease to be a filthy animal?`,
  `So I heard. May I come in?`,
  `So if we wanted, we could live in Bora Bora?`,
  `So if you're quitting the life, what'll you do?`,
  `So it all worked out in the finish?`,
  `So there could be five guys up there?`,
  `So we're cool?`,
  `So you decided to be a bum?`,
  `So you don't want to be a bank robber?`,
  `So you like chasing people, huh?`,
  `So you're gonna go out there, drink your drink, say "Goodnight, I've had a very lovely evening," go home, and jack off. And that's all you're gonna do.`,
  `So you're serious, you're really gonna quit?`,
  `So....`,
  `Something.`,
  `Sorry -- my house, my rules.`,
  `Sorry baby, I crashed the Honda.`,
  `Sorry.`,
  `Sounds like a shit job.`,
  `Spoken like a true prodigy. How 'bout you, Lash Larue? Can you keep your spurs from jingling and jangling?`,
  `Sprite, good, mind if I have some of your tasty beverage to wash this down with?`,
  `Sprite.`,
  `Step aside, Butch.`,
  `Still got your Malibu?`,
  `Still I hafta say, play with matches, ya get burned.`,
  `Stop fuckin' talkin' like that!`,
  `Stop talkin' to me, and start talkin' to her.`,
  `Strip.`,
  `Sure am.`,
  `Sure did.`,
  `Sure did. I heard you did a pilot.`,
  `Sure, but I think I'm still a little too petrified to laugh.`,
  `Sure, how do you take it?`,
  `Sure.`,
  `Sure.`,
  `Sure.`,
  `Sure.`,
  `Suzanne Vega the folk singer is your cousin?`,
  `Suzanne Vega's my cousin. If she's become a folk singer, I sure as hell don't know nothin' about it.`,
  `But then I haven't been to too many Thanksgivings lately.`,
  `Take care of her?`,
  `Take your time.`,
  `Tell 'em to shut up, he's gettin' on my nerves.`,
  `Tell 'em, Vincent.`,
  `Tell everyone to cooperate and it'll be all over.`,
  `Tell her to chill.`,
  `Tell me about it. I had the goddamn thing in storage three years.`,
  `It's out five fuckin' days -- five days, and some dickless piece of shit fucks with it.`,
  `Tell me.`,
  `Tell ya what, you give me one of them cigarettes, I'll give you an answer.`,
  `Thank you, Jimmie.`,
  `Thank you.`,
  `Thank you. And what is your name?`,
  `Thanks a bunch. Want a sausage?`,
  `Thanks.`,
  `Thanks.`,
  `That did it, man -- I'm fuckin' goin', that's all there is to it.`,
  `That door's gonna open in about thirty seconds, so git yourself together --`,
  `That give use forty minutes to get the fuck outta Dodge, which, if you do what I say when I say it, should by plenty.`,
  `Now you got a corpse in a car, minus a head, in a garage. Take me to it.`,
  `That is an impossibility. Trying to forget anything as intriguing as this would be an exercise in futility.`,
  `That one I need to speak with my accountant on.`,
  `That seems to be the situation. Now I don't want that and you don't want that and Ringo here don't want that. So let's see what we can do.`,
  `Now this is the situation. Normally both of your asses would be dead as fuckin' fried chicken.`,
  `But you happened to pull this shit while I'm in a transitional period. I don't wanna kill ya, I want to help ya.`,
  `But I'm afraid I can't give you the case. It don't belong to me.`,
  `Besides, I went through too much shit this morning on account of this case to just hand it over to your ass.`,
  `That shit wasn't luck. That shit was somethin' else.`,
  `That was a good idea.`,
  `That was a little bit more information than I needed to know, but for right ahead.`,
  `That was my fifteen minutes.`,
  `That was...divine intervention. You know what divine intervention is?`,
  `That' Zed.`,
  `That's a bold statement.`,
  `That's a damn shame.`,
  `That's all we want. We don't wanna fuck up your shit, We just need to call our people to bring us in.`,
  `That's all?`,
  `That's an interesting point, but let's get into character.`,
  `That's how you're gonna beat 'em, Butch. They keep underestimatin' ya.`,
  `That's it for me. For here on in, you can consider my ass retired.`,
  `That's it.`,
  `That's it...that's it boy, you're goin' fine. Oooooooh, just like that...that's good.`,
  `Stay still...stay still goddamn ya! Zed goddammit, git over here and hold 'em!`,
  `That's Marilyn Monroe...`,
  `That's me, pleased to meetcha. I'm still getting dressed. To your left, past the kitchen, is a bar.`,
  `Why don't you make yourself a drink, have a seat in the living room, and I'll be out within three shakes of a lamb's tail.`,
  `That's my bad motherfucker. Now open it up and take out the cash. How much is there?`,
  `That's no fair! I never get to see you.`,
  `That's not what I meant and you know it.`,
  `That's not what you said Vince. Well now I'm definitely not gonna tell ya, 'cause it's been built up too much.`,
  `That's one hell of a name you got there, sister.`,
  `That's one way to say it. Another way is, he was thrown out. Another was is, he was thrown out by Marsellus.`,
  `And even another way is, he was thrown out of a window by Marsellus because of you.`,
  `That's probably a good idea.`,
  `That's the one. That matches.`,
  `That's what I'm gonna find out. If they are, and I don't think I can handle it, I'll split.`,
  `That's what I've been sitting here contemplating. First, I'm gonna deliver this case to Marsellus. Then, basically, I'm gonna walk the earth.`,
  `That's what's fuckin' wit' me! I don't know why. But I can't go back to sleep.`,
  `That's when you know you found somebody special. When you can just shit the fuck up for a minute, and comfortably share silence.`,
  `The car didn't hit no motherfuckin' bump!`,
  `The difference is huge.`,
  `The guy's sufferin'. It's the right thing to do.`,
  `The life, most definitely.`,
  `The miracle we witnessed.`,
  `The miracle you witnessed. I witnessed a freak occurrence.`,
  `The name is Spanish, but I'm Columbian.`,
  `The only thing Antwan ever touched of mine was my hand, when he shook it. I met Anwan once -- at my wedding -- then never again.`,
  `The truth is, nobody knows why Marsellus tossed Tony Rocky Horror out of that window except Marsellus and Tony Rocky Horror.`,
  `But when you scamps get together, you're worse than a sewing circle.`,
  `The Partridge Family all the way, no comparison.`,
  `The radio said he was dead.`,
  `The time it is, is time for bed.`,
  `The truth. Three well-dressed, slightly toasted, Mexicans.`,
  `Then bite the fuckin' bullet, take 'er to a hospital and call a lawyer!`,
  `Then get up, lazy bones.`,
  `Then how come they're all beat up?`,
  `Then I did.`,
  `Then I suggest you get to it. Phone's in my bedroom.`,
  `Then let's just forget it.`,
  `Then she'll be fine.`,
  `Then why did you try to fuck 'im like a bitch?!`,
  `Then why don't you tell my boy here Vince, where you got the shit hid.`,
  `Then you understand what I'm sayin'?`,
  `There's a passage I got memorized, seems appropriate for this situation: Ezekiel 25:17.`,
  `The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men.`,
  `Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children.`,
  `And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers.`,
  `And you will know my name is the Lord when I lay my vengeance upon you."`,
  `There's a passage I got memorized, seems appropriate for this situation: Ezekiel 25:17.`,
  `The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men...."`,
  `And if you ever heard it, it meant your ass. I never really questioned what it meant. I thought it was just a cold-blooded thing to say to a motherfucker 'fore you popped a cap in his ass. But I saw some shit this mornin' made me think twice.`,
  `Now I'm thinkin', it could mean you're the evil man. And I'm the righteous man.`,
  `And Mr. .45 here, he's the shepherd protecting my righteous ass in the valley of darkness.`,
  `Or is could by you're the righteous man and I'm the shepherd and it's the world that's evil and selfish. I'd like that. But that shit ain't the truth.`,
  `The truth is you're the weak. And I'm the tyranny of evil men. But I'm tryin'. I'm tryin' real hard to be a shepherd.`,
  `They certainly do.`,
  `They did that to each other. They was fightin' when they came in. This one was gonna shoot that one.`,
  `They don't call it a Quarter Pounder with Cheese?`,
  `They should be fuckin' killed. No trial, no jury, straight to execution.`,
  `They talk a lot, don't they?`,
  `They you got the idea to take everybody's wallet.`,
  `They.`,
  `They're filthy animals. I don't eat filthy animals.`,
  `They're good.`,
  `Think nothing of it.`,
  `This ain't a fuckin' joke man!`,
  `This ain't Amsterdam, Vince. This is a seller's market. Coke is fuckin' dead as disco.`,
  `Heroin's comin' back in a big fuckin' way. It's this whole seventies retro. Bell bottoms, heroin, they're as hot as hell.`,
  `This fucked up bitch is Marsellus Wallace's wife. Now if she fuckin' croaks on me, I'm a grease spot.`,
  `But before he turns me into a bar soap, I'm gonna be forced to tell 'im about how you coulda saved her life, but instead you let her die on your front lawn.`,
  `This is me. I brush my teeth all night long and into the early morning. Do you think I have a problem?`,
  `This is my war. You see, Butch, what you're forgettin' is this watch isn't just a device that enables you to keep track of time.`,
  `This watch is a symbol. It's a symbol of how your father, and his father before him, and his father before him, distinguished themselves in war.`,
  `And when I took Marsellus Wallace's money, I started a war. This is my World War Two.`,
  `That apartment in North Hollywood, that's my Wake Island. In fact, if you look at it that way, it's almost kismet that Fabian left it behind.`,
  `And using that perspective, going back for it isn't stupid.`,
  `It may be dangerous, but it's not stupid. Because there are certain things in this world that are worth going back for.`,
  `This is really uncool.`,
  `This is the Valley, Vincent. Marsellus don't got no friendly places in the Valley.`,
  `This morning air is some chilly shit.`,
  `This one?`,
  `This place.`,
  `Those are hash bars?`,
  `Those pants are very nice. Can you wear those with that nice blue shirt you have?`,
  `Three or four.`,
  `Three tomatoes are walking down the street, a poppa tomato, a momma tomato, and a little baby tomato.`,
  `The baby tomato is lagging behind the poppa and momma tomato.`,
  `The poppa tomato gets mad, goes over to the momma tomato and stamps on him and says: catch up.`,
  `Time for bed. Sweet dream, jellybean.`,
  `To tell me how to do it. I've never given an adrenalin shot before.`,
  `To your bare ass.`,
  `Told ya.`,
  `Tony Rocky Horror.`,
  `Too late, I'm already here.`,
  `Towel 'em.`,
  `Trust me, I have one.`,
  `Uhhh...yes...beside the table drawer --`,
  `Uh-huh.`,
  `Uh-huh.`,
  `Uh-huh.`,
  `Uh-huh.`,
  `Uh-huh. You won't laugh because it's not funny. But if you still wanna hear it, I'll tell it.`,
  `Uh-huh?`,
  `Uncomfortable silences. Why do we feel it's necessary to yak about bullshit in order to be comfortable?`,
  `Unless you do it first.`,
  `Until God puts me where he want me to be.`,
  `Uuccch!`,
  `Uuummmm, that's a tasty burger. Vince, you ever try a Big Kahuna Burger?`,
  `Uuuuummmm, hit's the spot! You, Flock of Seagulls, you know what we're here for?`,
  `Vince, you can come in now!`,
  `Vincent Vega has entered the building, git your ass over here!`,
  `Vincent Vega, our man in Amsterdam, git your ass on in here.`,
  `Vincent Vega?`,
  `Vincent!`,
  `Wait a minute, before you guys split, I wanna get a picture of this.`,
  `Wait a minute, I wanna take a picture.`,
  `Wanna do it here?`,
  `Wanna share a cab?`,
  `Was than an uncomfortable silence?`,
  `We ain't at the finish, baby.`,
  `We ain't got time, man.`,
  `We cool?`,
  `We got time for one picture. You and Vincent get together.`,
  `We gotta be real fuckin' delicate with this Jimmie's situation. He's one remark away from kickin' our asses out the door.`,
  `We happy?`,
  `We happy?`,
  `We made more from the wallets then we did the register.`,
  `We should be fuckin' dead now, my friend! We just witnessed a miracle, and I want you to fuckin' acknowledge it!`,
  `We should be fuckin' dead!`,
  `We should have fuckin' shotguns.`,
  `We should have shotguns for this kind of deal.`,
  `We'd have to be talkin' 'bout one motherfuckin' charmin' pig. It'd have to be the Cary Grant of pigs.`,
  `Well done, now git your fuckin' ass on the ground.`,
  `Well don't by shy Vincent, what exactly did they say?`,
  `Well get her the hell outta here!`,
  `Well guess what, big man, you caught me --`,
  `Well he's ...he's...black --`,
  `Well I only got the chance to say one, 'cause we only did one show.`,
  `Well if it's that important, why didn't you keep it with the shot?`,
  `Well I'll tell you what, I'll go to the bathroom and powder my nose, while you sit here and think of something to say.`,
  `Well I'm of the opinion that Marsellus can live his whole live and never ever hear of this incident.`,
  `Well it's not here!`,
  `Well maybe not that fast, but fast. Okay? Okay?`,
  `Well take heart, 'cause you're never gonna hafta hear it again. Because since I'm never gonna do it again, you're never gonna hafta hear me quack about how I'm never gonna do it again.`,
  `Well then get it.`,
  `Well this here is Capt. Koons. He was in the P.O.W. camp with Daddy.`,
  `Well what then?`,
  `Well what then?`,
  `Well you better be thinkin' about it now, motherfucker! We gotta get this car off the road.`,
  `Cops tend to notice shit like you're driving a car drenched in fuckin' blood.`,
  `Well you should be happy, 'cause you do.`,
  `Well, don't look at me, this is your town, Jules.`,
  `Well, hash is legal there, right?`,
  `Well, I don't know exactly where her heart is, I think it's here.`,
  `Well, I guess you'll just wake 'em up then, won't you?`,
  `Well, if you like hamburgers give 'em a try sometime. Me, I can't usually eat 'em 'cause my girlfriend's a vegetarian.`,
  `Which more or less makes me a vegetarian, but I sure love the taste of a good burger. You know what they call a Quarter Pounder with Cheese in France?`,
  `Well, I'll be damned.`,
  `Well, in Amsterdam, you can buy beer in a movie theatre. And I don't mean in a paper cup either. They give you a glass of beer, like in a bar.`,
  `In Paris, you can buy beer at MacDonald's. Also, you know what they call a Quarter Pounder with Cheese in Paris?`,
  `Well, let's look at the grumpy man in the morning. I didn't say you were lying, it's just odd you don't remember your dreams.`,
  `I always remember mine. Did you know you talk in your sleep?`,
  `Well, let's not start suckin' each other's dicks quite yet.`,
  `Phase one is complete, clean the car, which moves us right along to phase two, clean you two.`,
  `Well, Marsellus fucked his ass up good. And word around the campfire, it was on account of Marsellus Wallace's wife.`,
  `Well, Marsellus is leavin' for Florida and when he's gone, he wants me to take care of Mia.`,
  `Well, the way they pick the shows on TV is they make one show, and that show's called a pilot.`,
  `And they show that one show to the people who pick the shows, and on the strength of that one show, they decide if they want to make more shows.`,
  `Some get accepted and become TV programs, and some don't, and become nothing. She starred in one of the ones that became nothing.`,
  `Well, we ain't leavin' 'til we made a couple phone calls. But I never want it to reach that pitch.`,
  `Jimmie's my friend and you don't bust in your friend's house and start tellin' 'im what's what.`,
  `Well, what else is there, day jobs?`,
  `Well, you know the shows on TV?`,
  `Well, you thought wrong.`,
  `Well, your Uncle Marsellus is.`,
  `And I'm positive if Uncle Conrad and Aunt Ginny were millionaires, they would've furnished you with a whole bedroom set, which your Uncle Marsellus is more than happy to do.`,
  `I like oak myself, that's what's in my bedroom. How 'bout you Jimmie, you an oak man?`,
  `Well, you're giving her an injection of adrenalin straight to her heart.`,
  `But she's got a breast plate in front of her heart, so you gotta pierce through that.`,
  `So what you gotta do is bring the needle down in a stabbing motion.`,
  `We're associates of your business partner Marsellus Wallace, you remember your business partner dont'ya?`,
  `We're cool. In fact, we're super- cool. But we gots to go. I'll wait for you outside.`,
  `We're doin' okay.`,
  `We're happy.`,
  `We're in a lot of danger, aren't we?`,
  `We're lucky we got it at all. Buddy Holly doesn't seem to be much of a waiter. We shoulda sat in Marilyn Monroe's section.`,
  `We're on our feet now, and now we're gonna talk out to the car. Here we go, watch us walk.`,
  `We're set. But his wife come home from work in an hour and a half and we gotta be outta there by then,`,
  `Were you Uncle Conrad and Aunt Ginny millionaires?`,
  `Whaddya mean?`,
  `Whaddya think?`,
  `What a gyp.`,
  `What about the man you fought?`,
  `What are you doing?`,
  `What are you lookin' for?`,
  `What are you watching?`,
  `What are your thoughts on how to handle this?`,
  `What country you from!`,
  `What did I say?`,
  `What did Marsellus do?`,
  `What do they call a Whopper?`,
  `What do you mean, walk the earth?`,
  `What do you need a medical book for?`,
  `What do you think about what happened to Antwan?`,
  `What do you think?`,
  `What does it feel like?`,
  `What does that mean?`,
  `What for?`,
  `What happened to my Honda?`,
  `What happens after that?`,
  `What have we been talking about? Yeah, no-more-liquor-stores. Besides, it ain't the giggle it usta be. Too many foreigners own liquor stores.`,
  `Vietnamese, Koreans, they can't fuckin' speak English. You tell 'em: "Empty out the register," and they don't know what it fuckin' means.`,
  `They make it too personal. We keep on, one of those gook motherfuckers' gonna make us kill 'em.`,
  `What if he never does?`,
  `What is it? What is it?`,
  `What now?`,
  `What now? Well let me tell you what now.`,
  `I'm gonna call a couple pipe-hittin' niggers, who'll go to work on homes here with a pair of pliers and a blow torch. Hear me talkin' hillbilly boy?!`,
  `I ain't through with you by a damn sight. I'm gonna git Medieval on your ass.`,
  `What so you want to know?`,
  `What the fuck am I doin'? Have I taken one too many hits to the head? That's gotta be it. Brain damage is the only excuse for this dumb a move.`,
  `Stop the car, Butch. Stop the car, Butch. Butch, I'm talkin' to you. Put- your-foot-on-the-break!`,
  `What the fuck did you just do to his towel?`,
  `What the fuck do you think I'm doing?! Are you sure you got it?`,
  `What the fuck does that mean?`,
  `What the fuck's goin' on here?`,
  `What the fuck's happening?`,
  `What the hell was that?`,
  `What time is it?`,
  `What time is it?`,
  `What time is it?`,
  `What time is it?`,
  `What was it about?`,
  `What was it?`,
  `What was that?`,
  `What was that?`,
  `What was your specialty?`,
  `What?`,
  `What?`,
  `What?`,
  `What?`,
  `What?`,
  `What?`,
  `What?`,
  `What?`,
  `What?`,
  `What? You said you're gonna give me a problem?`,
  `Whata re you looking for?`,
  `What'cha got?`,
  `What'd he do, fuck her?`,
  `What'd they call it?`,
  `What'd you say?`,
  `Whatever gave you that idea?`,
  `What's a pilot?`,
  `What's an act of God?`,
  `What's goin' on?`,
  `What's he lookin' for?`,
  `What's her name again?`,
  `What's her name?`,
  `What's her name?`,
  `What's in that?`,
  `What's so funny?`,
  `What's wrong with her?`,
  `What's wrong with that? People never rob restaurants, why not? Bars, liquor stores, gas stations, you get your head blown off stickin' up one of them.`,
  `Restaurants, on the other hand, you catch with their pants down. They're not expecting to get robbed, or not as expecting.`,
  `What's yours?`,
  `Whatsamatter? Oh, you were through anyway. Well, let me retort. Would you describe for me what Marsellus Wallace looks like?`,
  `When did you make this decision -- while you were sitting there eatin' your muffin?`,
  `When he wants it clean.`,
  `When you go on like this, you know what you sound like?`,
  `Where are we going to go?`,
  `Where did you get this motorcycle?`,
  `Where to?`,
  `Where's that reprobate daughter of yours?`,
  `Where's the big man?`,
  `Where's the shoe store?`,
  `Where's Toluca Lake.`,
  `Which one is it?`,
  `Which one, there's two Marilyn Monroes.`,
  `Which one's Trudi? The one with all the shit in her face?`,
  `While I'm doing this, take her shirt off and find her heart.`,
  `While you're at it, be sure to tell 'im why.`,
  `While you're lookin' for it, that girl's gonna die on our carpet. You're never gonna find it in all this shit.`,
  `For six months now, I've been telling you to clean this room --`,
  `Who told you this?`,
  `Who ya callin'?`,
  `Who?`,
  `Whoa, hold you horses man, what's the problem?`,
  `Whoa, this boy's got a bit of fight in 'em!`,
  `Whoa...whoa...whoa...stop right there. Eatin' a bitch out, and givin' a bitch a foot massage ain't even the same fuckin' thing.`,
  `Who's Antwan?`,
  `Who's Arlene Motika?`,
  `Who's first?`,
  `Who's she?`,
  `Who's Zed?`,
  `Whose chopper is this?`,
  `Why do you drive fast?`,
  `Why does it mean that?`,
  `Why don't you get up and we'll get some breakfast at that breakfast place with the pancakes.`,
  `Why not?`,
  `Why possible but unlikely?`,
  `Why the fuck did you do that?`,
  `Why the fuck didn't you tell us about that guy in the bathroom? Slip your mind? Forget he was in there with a goddamn hand cannon?`,
  `Why?`,
  `Will you kiss it?`,
  `Won't the gangsters be looking for you there?`,
  `Would you give me a foot massage -- I'm kinda tired.`,
  `Would you please?`,
  `Wrong guy, Ringo.`,
  `Wrong, wrong, this shit doesn't just happen.`,
  `She won't at that.`,
  `"Garcon" means boy.`,
  `Can I get anybody anymore coffee?`,
  `Yeah man, we're cool. One thing I ask -- two things I ask: don't tell nobody about this.`,
  `This shit's between me and you and the soon-to-be-livin'-the-rest-of-his- short-ass-life-in-agonizing-pain, Mr. Rapist here.`,
  `It ain't nobody else's business. Two: leave town. Tonight. Right now. And when you're gone, stay gone. You've lost your Los Angeles privileges. Deal?`,
  `Yeah maybe, fat right?`,
  `Yeah, but maybe I do.`,
  `Yeah, I think so. That means God came down from Heaven and stopped the bullets.`,
  `Yeah, it ain't Tuesday is it?`,
  `Yeah, it breaks down like this: it's legal to buy it, it's legal to own it and, if you're the proprietor of a hash bar, it's legal to sell it.`,
  `It's legal to carry it, which doesn't really matter 'cause -- get a load of this -- if the cops stop you, it's illegal for this to search you.`,
  `Searching you is a right that the cops in Amsterdam don't have.`,
  `Yeah, it has to be exact! I'm giving her an injection in the heart, so I gotta exactly hit her in the heart.`,
  `Yeah, it's legal, but is ain't a hundred percent legal. I mean you can't walk into a restaurant, roll a joint, and start puffin' away.`,
  `You're only supposed to smoke in your home or certain designated places.`,
  `Yeah, man, that's what is means. That's exactly what it means! God came down from Heaven and stopped the bullets.`,
  `Yeah, Marvin-Vincent-Vincent- Marvin.`,
  `Yeah, Marvin-Vincent-Vincent- Marvin.`,
  `Yeah, maybe.`,
  `Yeah, she's my cousin.`,
  `Yeah, we were lucky.`,
  `Yeah, well, out asses ain't the expert on wearin' dorky shit that your is.`,
  `Yeah.`,
  `Yeah.`,
  `Yeah.`,
  `Yeah.`,
  `Yeah.`,
  `Yeah. Exactly. Under the sink.`,
  `Yeah. I was just sitting here drinking my coffee, eating my muffin, playin' the incident in my head, when I had what alcoholics refer to as a "moment of clarity."`,
  `Yeah. She's dyin'.`,
  `Yep.`,
  `Yep.`,
  `Yes I've fuckin' looked!!`,
  `Yes we did.`,
  `Yes ya did Brett. Ya tried ta fuck 'im. You ever read the Bible, Brett?`,
  `Yes!`,
  `Yes!`,
  `Yes, but do you consider a dog to be a filthy animal?`,
  `Yes, but you're aware that there's an invention called television, and on that invention they show shows?`,
  `Yes, I did.`,
  `Yes, it was on your little kangaroo.`,
  `Yes, sleep is what you do after you've taken me to breakfast. Just get used to the idea, indulging me is the price of doing business at Monster Joe's Truck and Tow.`,
  `Yes, you did.`,
  `Yes.`,
  `Yes.`,
  `Yes.`,
  `Yolanda, how we doin, baby?`,
  `Yolanda, I thought you were gonna be cool. When you yell at me, it makes me nervous.`,
  `When I get nervous, I get scared. And when motherfuckers get scared, that's when motherfuckers get accidentally shot.`,
  `Yolanda.`,
  `You ain't gonna do a goddamn thing, now hang back and shut the fuck up.`,
  `Besides, I ain't givin' it to him. I'm buyin' somethin' for my money. Wanna know what I'm buyin' Ringo?`,
  `You ain't got no problems, Jules. I'm on the motherfucker.`,
  `Go back in there, chill them niggers out and wait for The Wolf, who should be comin' directly.`,
  `You always say that, the same thing every time: never again, I'm through, too dangerous.`,
  `You believe so? You either did, or you didn't, now which one is it?`,
  `You betcha. And if after awhile you don't dig Bora Bora, then we can move over to Tahiti or Mexico. Sprecher`,
  `You boss makes you do his laundry?`,
  `You can have his one, cowgirl.`,
  `You can use my straw, I don't have kooties.`,
  `You can't promise something like that. I have no idea what you're gonna ask.`,
  `You could ask me what you're gonna ask me, and my natural response could be to be offended.`,
  `Then, through no fault of my own, I woulda broken my promise.`,
  `You did last night.`,
  `You didn't listen to the radio?`,
  `You don't be givin' Marsellus Wallace's new bride a foot massage.`,
  `You don't mind if I shoot up here?`,
  `You don't open up that case, it's gonna be the last.`,
  `You don't put bourbon in it or anything?`,
  `You don't speak Bora Boran either. Besides, Mexican is easy: Donde esta el zapataria?`,
  `You don't think he overreacted?`,
  `You ever read the Bible, Brett?`,
  `You got to appreciate what an explosive element this Bonnie situation is.`,
  `If she comes home from a hard day's work and finds a bunch of gangsters doin' a bunch of gangsta' shit in her kitchen, ain't no tellin' what she's apt to do.`,
  `You gotta understand something, Winston. I want to help you guys out and all, but that's my best linen. It was a wedding present from my Uncle Conrad and Aunt Ginny, and they ain't with us anymore --`,
  `You had every right, I fucked up.`,
  `You hear that, young lady? Respect. You could lean a lot from those two fine specimens. Respect for one's elders shows character.`,
  `You heard Marsellus threw Rocky Horror out of a four-story window because he massaged my feet?`,
  `You just woke up from it.`,
  `You killed the other boxing man.`,
  `You know how they use that gun when they pierce your ears? They don't use that when they pierce your nipples, do they?`,
  `You know I could go for some breakfast. What to have breakfast with me?`,
  `You know what some fucker did to it the other day?`,
  `You know what you two look like?`,
  `You know why you didn't see that sign?`,
  `You know, like Caine in "KUNG FU." Just walk from town to town, meet people, get in adventures.`,
  `You Mexicans in the kitchen, get out here! Asta luego!`,
  `You must be Jules, which would make you Vincent. Let's get down to brass tacks, gentlemen.`,
  `If I was informed correctly, the clock is ticking, is that right, Jimmie?`,
  `You okay?`,
  `You remember Antwan Rockamora? Half-black, half-Samoan, usta call him Tony Rocky Horror.`,
  `You sendin' The Wolf?`,
  `You sound like a duck. Quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack...`,
  `You still got an adrenalin shot?`,
  `You still wanna hear my "FOX FORCE FIVE" joke?`,
  `You think guys would find that attractive?`,
  `You told it in front of fifty million people and you can't tell it to me? I promise I won't laugh.`,
  `You wanna bite, they're real good.`,
  `You wanna fight? You wanna fight? Good, I like to fight!`,
  `You wanna rob banks?`,
  `You want me to have a pot?`,
  `You want that gun, Zed? Pick it up.`,
  `You watched me wash 'em.`,
  `You were in that fight? The fight on the radio -- you're the fighter?`,
  `You were lookin' in the mirror and you wish you had some pot?`,
  `You win.`,
  `You'd do that to me?`,
  `You'd punch me in my belly?`,
  `You'll dig it the most. But you know what the funniest thing about Europe is?`,
  `Your life. I'm givin' you that money so I don't hafta kill your ass. You read the Bible?`,
  `Your wife, Bonnie comes home at 9:30 in the AM, is that correct?`,
  `You're dry enough, give 'em their clothes.`,
  `You're gettin' ready to blow? I'm a mushroom-cloud-layin' motherfucker!`,
  `Every time my fingers touch brain I'm "SUPERFLY T.N.T," I'm the "GUNS OF NAVARONE." I'm what Jimmie Walker usta talk about.`,
  `In fact, what the fuck am I doin' in the back? You're the motherfucker should be on brain detail.`,
  `We're tradin'. I'm washin' windows and you're pickin' up this nigger's skull.`,
  `You're gonna be takin' Mia Wallace out on a date?`,
  `You're gonna give her the shot.`,
  `You're gonna give me a problem?`,
  `You're hurt?`,
  `You're Jimmie, right? This is your house?`,
  `You're prejudiced because you love me.`,
  `You're quite the silver tongue devil, aren't you?`,
  `You're supposed to wash 'em first.`,
  `Yours is this one, right?`,
  `You've had that thing for six years and you never used it?`,
  `Yummy!`,
  `Zed? It's Maynard. The spider just caught a coupl'a flies.`,
  `Zed's dead, baby, Zed's dead.`,
  `Zed's.`,
