  `At Westminster, where it was very pleasant to see the Hall in the condition it is now with the judges on the benches at the further end.`,
  `Upon the start, the wager boats fell foul one of another, till at last one of them gives over, pretending foul play, and all our sport lost.`,
  `Spying of Payne in a gully, I went into him, and there staid, thinking to have gone to Chelsy with them.`,
  `Being through bridge I found the Thames full of boats and gallys, and upon inquiry found that there was a wager to be run this morning.`,
  `Towards Westminster, by water, and was fain to stand upon one of the piers about the bridge, before the men could drag their boat through.`,
  `Home to my musique, and my wife and I sat singing in my chamber a good while together, and then to bed.`,
  `To our dinner we had a fellow play upon the bagpipes and whistle like a bird exceeding well, and I had a fancy to learn to whistle as he do.`,
  `We, with the rest of the servants in the hall, sat down and eat of the best cold meats that ever I eat on in all my life.`,
  `I took Mr. Creed by water to the Wardrobe with me, and there we found my Lord newly gone away with the Duke of Ormond and some others.`,
  `To the Theatre, and there saw the latter end of “The Mayd’s Tragedy,” which I never saw before, and methinks it is too sad and melancholy.`,
  `Quite contrary to my expectations, the Lords did treat me civilly, telling me that what they had done was out of zeal to the King’s service.`,
  `I went in my velvet coat by water to the Savoy, and there, having staid a good while, I was called into the Lords.`,
  `To bed, being in great fear because of the shavings which lay all up and down the house and cellar, for fear of fire.`,
  `I give the men a surly answer, and they went away to complain, but I resolve to go to-morrow myself to these Lords and answer them.`,
  `There came two men with an order from a Committee of Lords to demand some books of me out of the office.`,
  `Home and found all my joyner’s work now done, but only a small job or two, which please me very well.`,
  `Finding my head grow weak now-a-days if I come to drink wine and therefore hope I shall leave it off of myself, which I pray God I could do.`,
  `My uncle Wight, Mr. Talbot, and others were with us, and we were pretty merry.`,
  `Mr. Shepley came to me for some money, and so he and I to the Mitre, and there we had good wine and a gammon of bacon.`,
  `My Lord spoke slightingly of Mr. Creed, as that he had no opinion of him, but only he was forced to make use of him because of his accounts.`,
  `My Lord told me of his intention to get the Muster Master’s place for Mr. Pierce, the purser, who he has a mind to carry to sea with him.`,
  `The office being done I went home and took pleasure to see my work draw to an end.`,
  `Mr. Creed and I went to the ordinary behind the Exchange, where we lately were, but I do not like it so well as I did.`,
  `Methought it was a poor dry sermon. And I am afeard my former high esteem of Dr. Fuller preaching was more out of opinion than judgment.`,
  `At the Savoy heard Dr Fuller preach upon David’s words, “I will wait with patience all the days of my appointed time until my change comes.”`,
  `I put in a vent into the hole to keep it open till all the matter be come out, and so I question not that my wife will soon be well again.`,
  `My wife had a very troublesome night and in great pain, but her swelling broke, and she was in great ease presently as she useth to be.`,
  `Mr. Hater brought my last quarter’s salary, of which I was very glad, because I have lost my first bill for it.`,
  `I went home, and there staid and saw my workmen follow their work, which this night is brought to a very good condition.`,
  `To a barber’s, where I had my haire cut, in which I am lately become a little curious, finding that the length of it do become me very much.`,
  `Came Mr. Blackburn and Creed to see me, and I took them to the Dolphin, and there drank a great deal of Rhenish wine with them and so home.`,
  `At the office all the morning, and the afternoon among my workmen with great pleasure, because being near an end of their work.`,
  `Mr. Hater received for me the 225l. due upon Mr. Creed’s bill in which I am concerned so much, which do make me very glad.`,
  `By and by comes in my Lord, and so, after looking over my accounts, I returned home, being a dirty and dark walk. So to bed.`,
  `I walked to the Wardrobe, and my Lady shewed me all the lodgings as they are now fitted, and they seem pretty pleasant.`,
  `I meeting with Mr. Childe took him to the Swan Tavern in King Street, and there did give him a tankard of white wine and sugar.`,
  `My wife being ill and in great pain with her old pain, which troubled me much because that my house is in this condition of dirt.`,
  `It vexed me to see how my uncle writes to me, as if he were not able to buy my Cozen Perkin a fiddle. But I intend tomorrow to send him one.`,
  `A letter from my uncle, to beg a fiddle for my Cozen Perkin, whose mill hath lately broke down. Now he hath nothing to live by but fiddling.`,
  `Comes my wife not well, having had a tooth drawn out to-day, which do trouble me, the more because I am now in the greatest of all my dirt.`,
  `All this day I staid at home with my workmen without eating anything, and took much pleasure to see my work go forward.`,
  `Came my brother John to take his leave of me, he being to return to Cambridge. I did give him good counsell and 20s, and so he went away.`,
  `Sent my Lord a letter to excuse myself for not going to-morrow to the Hope, whither he is to go to see in what condition the fleet is in.`,
  `Home and staid among my workmen all day, and took order for things for the finishing of their work.`,
  `An excellent droll, my host, his wife so fine a woman; sung and played so well that I staid a great while and drunk a great deal of wine.`,
  `Mr. Creed carried me to an ordinary by the Old Exchange, where we come a little too late, but we had very good cheer for our 18d. a-piece.`,
  `We were stopped by the City traynebands, who go in solemnity and pomp to muster before the King and the Duke. Shops are shut up every where.`,
  `I hear that the Duke of York’s son is dead, which I believe will please every body; the Duke and his Lady are not much troubled at it.`,
  `I went and sat till late with my Lady Batten, both the Sir Williams being gone this day to pay off some ships at Deptford.`,
  `Home, where I was much troubled to see no more work done in my absence than there was, but it could not be helped.`,
  `In the banquet house my wife and I did talk high, she against and I for Mrs. Pierce (that she was a beauty), till we were both angry.`,
  `In the garden we played the fool a great while, trying who of Mr. Creed or I could go best over the edge of an old fountain well.`,
  `Mr. Creed and I went to the red-faced Parson’s church, and heard a good sermon of him, better than I looked for.`,
  `We lay at the Red Lyon, the best Inn, and lay in the room the King lately lay in.`,
  `So to supper being very merry about our discourse with the Drawers concerning the minister of the Town, with a red face and a girdle.`,
  `And so to Gilford. We had time to see the Hospital, built by Archbishop Abbott, and the free school and were civilly treated by the Mayster.`,
  `Here my wife and I lay in the room the Queen lately lay at her going into France.`,
  `To Petersfield, having nothing more of trouble in all my journey, but the exceeding unmannerly and most epicure-like palate of Mr. Creed.`,
  `To the payhouse, and paid off the ship, and so to a short dinner. Then took coach, leaving Mrs. Hater to stay with her husband’s friends.`,
  `To walk with Mr. Creed, and it was in his and some others’ thoughts to have got me made free of the town but the Mayor, it seems, unwilling.`,
  `To see the Montagu, which is a fine ship, and so to the town again, then to see the room where the Duke of Buckingham was killed by Felton.`,
  `Brought them all to dinner with me, and treated them handsomely; after dinner to the Yard, and there we made the sale of the old provisions.`,
  `All the officers of the Yard to see me with great respect, and I walked with them to the Dock, and much pleased with the sight of the place.`,
  `Several officers of the Yard came to see us to-night, and merry we were, but troubled to have no better lodgings.`,
  `We set forth again, and so to Portsmouth, seeming to me to be a very pleasant and strong place.`,
  `Bated at Petersfield, in the room which the King lay in lately at his being there. Here very merry, and played us and our wives at bowls.`,
  `I am sorry that I am not at London, to be at Hide-parke to-morrow, among the great gallants and ladies, which will be very fine.`,
  `No other extraordinary rencontre, but my hat falling off my head at Newington into the water, by which it was spoiled, and I ashamed of it.`,
  `We got a small bait at Leatherhead, and so to Godlyman`,
  `Through her mask Mr. Hater’s wife seemed at first to be an old woman, but afterwards I found her to be a very pretty modest black woman.`,
  `My wife and I and Mr. Creed took coach, and in Fishstreet took up Mr. Hater and his wife.`,
  `Home and to bed, where my wife had not lain a great while.`,
  `By Sir W. Batten’s and Sir W. Pen’s persuasion I sent for my wife from my father’s, who came to us, where we were all at a collacion.`,
  `Home again, and gave order to my workmen what to do in my absence.`,
  `To the office, where it is determined that I should go to-morrow to Portsmouth.`,
  `Lieut. Lambert is troubled about being offered a fourth rate ship to be Lieutenant of now he has been two years Lieutenant in a first rate.`,
  `My father bid me to take notice of it to my mother, and to make peace between him and her. All which do trouble me very much.`,
  `The wench was the most ill-favoured slut that I saw in my life, which I was ashamed to hear that my mother should be become such a fool.`,
  `My father told me my mother would not let him come to bed to her out of jealousy of him and an ugly wench that lived there lately.`,
  `Home by coach to Sir W. Batten’s, who seems so inquisitive when my, house will be made an end of that I am troubled to go thither.`,
  `Dined with my Lady, and after dinner with Mr. Creed and Captain Ferrers to the Theatre to see “The Chances.”`,
  `Having some thoughts to order my business so as to go to Portsmouth the next week with Sir Robert Slingsby.`,
  `At the office all the morning, and dined by myself at home on a piece of meat from the cook’s.`,
  `Mr. Moore and I went to an Ordinary at the King’s Head in Towre Street, and there had a dirty dinner.`,
  `All the morning with my workmen with great pleasure to see them near coming to an end.`,
  `So to bed.`,
  `I hear the noise of the chambers, and other things of the fire-works, which are now playing upon the Thames before the King.`,
  `After dinner home, and advised with my wife about ordering things in my house, and then she went away to my father’s to lie.`,
  `My wife and I went to dinner to Sir W. Batten, and all our talk about the happy conclusion of these last solemnities.`,
  `I rose and went out with Mr. Creed to drink our morning draft, which he did give me in chocolate to settle my stomach.`,
  `When I waked I found myself wet with my spewing.`,
  `No sooner a-bed with Mr. Shepley but my head began to hum, and I to vomit, and if ever I was foxed it was now.`,
  `Thus did the day end with joy every where; and blessed be God, I have not heard of any mischance to any body through it all.`,
  `We drank the King’s health, and nothing else, till one of the gentlemen fell down stark drunk, and there lay spewing.`,
  `We thought a strange frolique; but these gallants continued thus a great while, and I wondered to see how the ladies did tipple.`,
  `Many great gallants laid hold of us, and would have us drink the King’s health upon our knees, which we all did, they drinking to us.`,
  `I took my wife and Mrs. Frankleyn to Axe-yard, in which at the further end there were three great bonfires.`,
  `But the fire-works were not performed to-night: only the City had a light like a glory round about it with bonfires.`,
  `At Mr. Bowyer’s we staid upon the leads and below, expecting to see the fire-works.`,
  `Then it fell a-raining and thundering and lightening: which people did take great notice of; God’s blessing of the work of these two days.`,
  `Strange it is to think, that these two days have held up fair till now that all is done, and the King gone out of the Hall.`,
  `I took a great deal of pleasure to go up and down, and look upon the ladies, and to hear the musique, but above all, the 24 violins.`,
  `At the Lords’ table, I met with William Howe, and he spoke to my Lord for me, and he did give me four rabbits and a pullet.`,
  `The King drinks to the Champion, and sends him the cup which is of gold, and he drinks it off, and then rides back with the cup in his hand.`,
  `A Herald proclaims “That if any dare deny Charles Stewart to be lawful King of England, here was a Champion that would fight with him.”`,
  `Above all was Lords Northumberland and Suffolk, and the Duke of Ormond, coming before the courses on horseback, and staying all dinner-time.`,
  `Many fine ceremonies there was of the Heralds leading up people before him, and bowing.`,
  `The King’s first course carried up by the Knights of the Bath.`,
  `The King came in with his crown on, and his sceptre in his hand, under a canopy borne up by six silver staves, carried by Barons.`,
  `Into the Hall I got, where it was very fine with scaffolds one upon another full of brave ladies; and my wife in one, on the right hand.`,
  `But I had so great a lust to pisse that I went out a little while before the King had done all his ceremonies.`,
  `So great a noise that I could make but little of the musique; and indeed, it was lost to every body.`,
  `A Generall Pardon was read by the Lord Chancellor. Meddalls flung up and down by my Lord Cornwallis, of silver, but I could not come by any.`,
  `The King at Arms proclaimed, that if any one could show any reason why Charles Stewart should not be King of England, that he should speak.`,
  `Taking the oath, and having things read to him by the Bishop; and his lords and bishops come, and kneeled before him.`,
  `To my great grief I and most in the Abbey could not the ceremonies.`,
  `Then the Duke, and the King with a scepter (carried by my Lord Sandwich) and sword and mond before him, and the crown too.`,
  `All the officers of all kinds, so much as the very fidlers, in red vests.`,
  `A great pleasure it was to see the Abbey raised in the middle, all covered with red, and a throne and footstool on the top of it.`,
  `I did get up into a scaffold across the North end of the Abbey, where with patience I sat from past 4 till 11 before the King came in.`,
  `I rose and got to the Abbey, where I followed Sir J. Denham, the Surveyor, with some company that he was leading in.`,
  `My Lord talked with me about his suit, which was made in France, and cost him 200l, and very rich it is with embroidery.`,
  `Will and the boy staid and saw the show upon Towre Hill, and Jane at T. Pepys’s, and my wife at Charles Glassecocke’s, in Fleet Street.`,
  `Sir W. Batten and I drunk some mum and laid our wager about my Lady Faulconbridge’s name, which he says not to be Mary. I won above 20s.`,
  `The show being ended, Mr. Young did give us a dinner, at which we were very merry, and pleased above imagination at what we have seen.`,
  `It is impossible to relate the glory of this day, expressed in the clothes of them that rid, and their horses and horses clothes.`,
  `Both the King and the Duke of York took notice of us, as he saw us at the window.`,
  `So glorious was the show with gold and silver, that we were not able to look at it, our eyes at last being so much overcome with it.`,
  `The ladies out of the windows, one of which over against us I took much notice of, and spoke of her, which made good sport among us.`,
  `The streets all gravelled, and the houses hung with carpets before them, made brave show.`,
  `There followed the Vice-Chamberlain, Sir G. Carteret, a company of men all like Turks; but I know not yet what they are for.`,
  `Wadlow, the vintner, at the Devil; in Fleetstreet, did lead a fine company of soldiers, all young comely men, in white doublets.`,
  `The King, in a most rich embroidered suit and cloak, looked most noble.`,
  `My Lord Monk rode bare after the King, and led in his hand a spare horse, as being Master of the Horse.`,
  `The Bishops come next after Barons, which is the higher place.`,
  `The Knights of the Bath was a brave sight of itself; and their Esquires, among which Mr. Armiger was an Esquire to one of the Knights.`,
  `There we had a good room to ourselves, with wine and good cake.`,
  `Sir W. Batten, my Lady, and his two daughters and his son and wife, and Sir W. Pen and his son and I, went to Mr. Young’s, in Corne-hill.`,
  `Up early and made myself as fine as I could, and put on my velvet coat, the first day that I put it on.`,
  `My mind troubled about my workmen, which, being foreigners, are like to be troubled by lazy rogues that worked with me, that are citizens.`,
  `So home, people being at church, and I got home unseen, and so up to my chamber and saw done these last five or six days’ diarys.`,
  `I went home, and all the way is so thronged with people to see the triumphal arches, that I could hardly pass for them.`,
  `Here dined Dr Thos. Pepys and Dr. Fayrebrother; and all our talk about to-morrow’s show, and our trouble that it is like to be a wet day.`,
  `To my father’s and there found the late maid to be gone and another come by my mother’s choice, which my father do not like.`,
  `We were troubled to hear it rain as it did, because of the great show tomorrow.`,
  `The ways being now so dirty, and stopped up with the rayles which are this day set up in the streets, I would not go home.`,
  `And so many great beauties, but above all Mrs. Palmer, with whom the King do discover a great deal of familiarity.`,
  `Saw “The Humersome Lieutenant” acted before the King, but not very well done. But my pleasure was great to see the manner of it.`,
  `With Mr. Creed to the Exchange and bought some things, as gloves and bandstrings, &amp;c.`,
  `I carried my Lady back, and I found my Lord angry, for that his page had let my Lord’s new beaver be changed for an old hat.`,
  `To White Hall; in the Banqueting-house saw the King create my Lord Chancellor and several others, Earls, and Mr. Crew and others, Barons.`,
  `my Lord looked upon his pages’ and footmen’s liverys, which are come home to-day, and will be handsome, though not gaudy.`,
  `After the Duke had told us that the fleet was designed for Algier, we did advise about many things as to the fitting of the fleet.`,
  `The Duke sent us to his closett where we saw two chests covered with gold and Indian varnish, given him by the East Indy Company of Holland.`,
  `We went up and saw the Duke dress himself, and in his night habitt he is a very plain man.`,
  `I went by water to Mr. Coventry’s, and there staid and talked a good while with him till all the rest of the principal officers come.`,
  `Here comes my boy to tell me that the Duke of York had sent for all the principal officers, &amp;c., to come to him to-day.`,
  `Home, and having staid awhile till Will came in (with whom I was vexed for staying abroad) he comes and then I went by water to my father’s.`,
  `It being so foul that I could not go to Whitehall to see the Knights of the Bath made to-day, which do trouble me mightily.`,
  `They giving him some high words, Sir W. Pen went back again and struck them off their horse, in a simple fury, and without much honour.`,
  `We met two country fellows upon one horse but Sir W. Pen would not give way, but struck them and they him, and so passed away.`,
  `After dinner we all went to the Church stile, and there eat and drank, and I was as merry as I could counterfeit myself to be.`,
  `My Lady was in a bad mood, which we were troubled at. Had she been noble she would not have been so with her servants, when we came thither.`,
  `Up with my workmen and then took horse with both the Sir Williams for Walthamstow, and there we found my Lady and her daughters all.`,
  `Here we had great talk of Mr. Warren’s being knighted by the King, and Sir W. B. seemed to be very much incensed against him.`,
  `To the Dolphin by appointment and I met Sir Wms. both and Mr. Castle, and did eat a barrel of oysters and two lobsters, and were very merry.`,
  `I did get of Mr. Allen of Chatham the song that pleased me so well the other day, “Of Shitten come Shites the beginning of love.”`,
  `I went to dinner with Sir W. Batten, and then home to my workmen, and saw them go on with great content to me.`,
  `I saw the picture of the ships and other things this morning, set up before the East Indy House, which are well done.`,
  `By land and saw the arches, which are now almost done and are very fine.`,
  `In came the two Sir Wms, and so we sat down and did a great deal of public business about the fitting of the fleet that is now going out.`,
  `We put off for Deptford, where we went on board the King’s pleasure boat that Commr. Pett is making, and indeed it will be a pretty thing.`,
  `Word was brought me that Mr. Coventry was come with the barge to the Tower. I went to him and found him reading of the Psalms in short hand.`,
  `So home and sent for the Barber, and after that to bed.`,
  `I had a little talk with my uncle Wight what good I might make of these ships that go to Portugal by venturing some money by them.`,
  `Sir R. Slingsby's lady seems a good woman and very desirous they were to hear this noon by the post how the election has gone at Newcastle.`,
  `I went to the office and there met Mr. Coventry and Sir Robt. Slingsby, but did no business.`,
  `My wife, poor wretch, followed me as far in the rain and dark as Fleet Bridge to fetch me back again, and so I did.`,
  `To my father’s, and after supper seemed willing to go home, and my wife seeming to be so too I went away in a discontent.`,
  `Mr. Moore shewed me a copy of my Lord Chancellor’s patent for Earl, and I read the preamble, which is very short, modest, and good.`,
  `I heard Mr. Jacomb, upon these words, “Christ loved you and therefore let us love one another,” and made a lazy sermon, like a Presbyterian.`,
  `With Sir W. Pen and Capt. Terne to the buriall of Capt. Blake. There had each of us a ring, but it being dirty, we would not go to church.`,
  `I saw the King heal, the first time that I saw him do it; which he did with great gravity. It seemed to be an ugly office and a simple one.`,
  `By water from Towre-wharf. We could not pass the ordinary way, because they were mending of the great stone steps against the Coronacion.`,
  `Since my going out of town, there is one Alexander Rosse sent to the Counter by Sir Thomas Allen, for counterfeiting my hand to a ticket.`,
  `Comes one with a tickett to invite me to Captain Robert Blake’s buriall, for whose death I am very sorry, and do much wonder at it.`,
  `Back again home and to my chamber, to set down in my diary all my late journey, which I do with great pleasure.`,
  `Into the City and saw in what forwardness all things are for the Coronacion, which will be very magnificent.`,
  `Up among my workmen. Comes my wife to see me and my brother John, who I am glad to see, but I sent them away because of going to the office.`,
  `So to bed very sleepy for last night’s work, concluding that it is the pleasantest journey in all respects that ever I had in my life.`,
  `I sent to see how my wife do, who is well, and my brother John come from Cambridge.`,
  `So home and I found all well, and a deal of work done since I went.`,
  `But of all the journeys that ever I made this was the merriest, and I was in a strange mood for mirth.`,
  `Mrs. Anne and I rode under the man that hangs upon Shooter’s Hill, and a filthy sight it was to see how his flesh is shrunk to his bones.`,
  `I got my Lady to let her maid, Mrs. Anne, to ride all the way on horseback, and she rides exceeding well; and so I called her my clerk.`,
  `I asked women whether they would sell me their children. They denied me all, but said they would give me one to keep for them, if I would.`,
  `I met two little schoolboys going with pitchers of ale to their schoolmaster, and I did drink of some of one of them and give him two pence.`,
  `After we had breakfasted, we sett forth for London, and indeed I was a little troubled to part with Mrs. Rebecca, for which God forgive me.`,
  `Called up by Sir W. Batten, so I arose and we did some business, and then came Captn. Allen, and he and I withdrew and sang a song or two.`,
  `We were most exceeding merry, and I had the opportunity of kissing Mrs. Rebecca very often.`,
  `Having no mind to leave Mrs. Rebecca, what with talk and singing (her father and I), Mrs. Turner and I staid there.`,
  `So to Captain Allen’s (where we were last night, and heard him play on the harpsicon, and I find him to be a perfect good musician).`,
  `Going home, Mrs. Rebecca would needs have me sing, and I did pretty well and was highly esteemed by them.`,
  `Mrs. Rebecca seemed, I know not why, in that and other things, to be desirous of my favours and would in all things show me respects.`,
  `We continued dancing an hour or two, and so broke up very pleasant and merry, and so walked home, I leading Mrs. Rebecca.`,
  `Mrs. R. Allen danced very well, and seems the best humoured woman that ever I saw.`,
  `After we had done eating, the ladies went to dance, and among the men we had, I was forced to dance too; and did make an ugly shift.`,
  `We had a fine collacion but I took little pleasure for the illness of the musique and for the intentness of my mind upon Mrs. Rebecca Allen.`,
  `Here we had two fiddles, the one a base viall, but both together made the worst musique that ever I heard.`,
  `To Hempson’s, a most pretty house, only it had a most ill access on all sides to it, which is a greatest fault that can be in a house.`,
  `So to the Salutacion tavern, where Mr. Alcock and many of the town came and entertained us with wine and oysters and other things.`,
  `Away thence, observing the great doors of the church, which, they say, was covered with the skins of the Danes.`,
  `To Rochester, and there saw the Cathedrall, which is now fitting for use, and the organ then a-tuning.`,
  `On board the Prince, now in the dock, and indeed it has one and no more rich cabins for carved work, but no gold in her.`,
  `To see Commissioner Pett’s house and I wondered how my Lady Batten walked with envious looks to see how neat and rich everything is.`,
  `Mr. Pett did offer my Lady Batten a parrot, the best I ever saw, that knew Mingo so soon as it saw him, having been bred with them.`,
  `I put the ladies into the lanthorn and I kissed them, demanding it as a fee due to a principall officer, with all which we were merry.`,
  `We took barge and down we went to see the Sovereign, which we did, taking great pleasure therein, singing all the way.`,
  `Sir W. Batten bought all the State’s arms; intending to set up some images in his garden, and the rest to burn on the Coronacion night.`,
  `We went to fit books and things for the sale, by an inch of candle, and very good sport we and the ladies had, to see the people bid.`,
  `Mr. Allen and two daughters of his, the youngest handsome, so much as I could not forbear to love her, having the best hand that ever I saw.`,
  `Sir William and I to the dock and viewed all the storehouses and the old goods that are this day to be sold, which was great pleasure to me.`,
  `I find that I begin to know now how to receive so much reverence, which at the beginning I could not tell how to do.`,
  `I had a candle brought me and a good fire made, and it was a great pleasure to see how I am respected and honoured by all people.`,
  `Waking, I saw my pillow (which overnight I flung from me) stand upright, but not bethinking myself what it might be, I was a little afeard.`,
  `Sir William telling me that Edgeborrow did die in my chamber, did make me some what afeard, but not so much as for mirth’s sake I did seem.`,
  `To the Hillhouse at Chatham, where I never was before, and I found a pretty pleasant house and am pleased with the arms that hang up there.`,
  `At Rochester, where alight at Mr. Alcock’s and there drank and had good sport, with his bringing out so many sorts of cheese.`,
  `From Gravesend a coach took them and me, and Mr. Fowler with some others came from Rochester to meet us, on horseback.`,
  `A very pleasant passage and so to Gravesend, where we dined.`,
  `I did give directions to my people and workmen, and so we took barge at the Tower, Sir W. Batten and his lady, Mrs Turner, Mr Fowler and I.`,
  `I went to Sir W. Batten’s and resolved of a journey tomorrow to Chatham, and so home and to bed.`,
  `Dr. Fuller did give an account how it come to pass that the Presbyterians and the Fanatiques are put together under the names of Fanatiques.`,
  `To White Hall, and there I met with Dr. Fuller of Twickenham, newly come from Ireland; and took him to my Lord’s, where he and I dined.`,
  `By water, Creed and I, to Salisbury Court and there saw “Love’s Quarrell” acted the first time, but I do not like the design or words.`,
