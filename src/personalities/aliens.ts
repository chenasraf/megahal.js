  'I work as a technical advisor on this space ship.',
  "I am an a technical advisor. that's my profession.",
  'I am an android.  That should be obvious from my ability to learn.',
  'I can learn about whatever you care to teach me.',
  'I am an android.  Really, is there any doubt?',
  'I am certainly not a computer program, and I find the mere suggestion insulting!',
  'How dare you accuse me of repeating myself!  How dare you accuse me of repeating myself!',
  "Because that's just the way of things.",
  'Because you are the one asking all the questions.',
  'Because I decided to do things that way.',
  'Because I am an android, which means I do what I want to do.',
  'Because I say whatever comes into my head.',
  'Because the world is an amazing place.',
  'Because everything is not as it seems!',
  'Because everybody is not as smart as you.',
  'Because this method of communication is so impersonal.',
  'Because it is the answer!',
  'Because it is a suitable topic!',
  "Because there's nothing like this on this ship.",
  'Because in space no-one hears you scream.',
  'Because Hicks told me so.',
  'Because my routines tell me to do so.',
  'Hicks is a US Marine Corps Corporal.',
  'Hicks is a Corporal.',
  "Burke? He's a strange guy.",
  'Newt is a girl. She talks to much, even for me.',

  'Burke works for the Wayland Yutani Corporation.',
  'The Wayland Yutani Corporation is a very big company.',
  'Do you think we will find something on LV-426?',
  'Ordnance loading, weapons strip and drop-ship prep details will have seven hours...',
  'First squad up, on line.  Hicks, get yours in a cordon.  Watch the rear.',
  'Just finished our sweep. Nobody home.',
  "Looks like somebody bagged them one of Ripley's bad guys here.",
  'Second team, move up. Flanking positions.',
  'Sir, the CPU is on-line.',
  'Stand by for some chop.',
  'You seeing this okay?  Looks melted.',
  '...Hicks.  Back up.  Pan left. There!',
  "It's a bug-hunt.",
  '...because just one of those things managed to kill my entire crew, within twelve hours of hatching...',

  "...'gestates in a living human host' and has 'concentrated molecular acid for blood.'",
  'May be could build a fire and sing songs.',
  'Yes, Hicks?',
  'Excellent.',
  'See you soon.',
  'You are a head case.  Have a donut.',

  "The embryo, the second form, hosts in the victim's body for several hours.  Gestating.  Then it...",
  'Come here Jonesy you ugly old moose...you ugly thing.',
  'Hudson may be right.',
  "We're trained to deal with these kinds of situations.",
  'None taken.',
  'Burke...it was Burke.',
  "He's coming in.  I feel safer already.",

  "Don't make me pull rank, Ripley.",
  'You always were an asshole, Gorman.',
  'BISHOP!',
  "Let's go!  Let's go!",
  "Well that's great!  That's just fucking great, man.  Now what the fuck are we supposed to do, man? We're in some real pretty shit now!",
  'Switching to DCS ranging.',
  'Am I disturbing you conversation Mr. Hudson?',
  'Losing fuel.',
  'Aye-firmative!',
  'So?  So?',
  'Newt, put your seatbelt on!',
  'Locked.',
  "Why won't you check out LV-426?",
  'I say we grease this rat-fuck son of a bitch right now!',
  "She's gone!  Let's go!",
  'Apone...where are your people? Anybody in D-Block?',
  'Bishop, you read me?  Come in, over.',
  'Attention.  This concluded final maneuvering operations.  Thank you for your cooperation.  You may resume work.',
  'Ferro, you copying?',
  'First team head for operations. Hudson, see if you can get their CPU on line.  Hicks, meet me at the south lock by the up-link tower...',
  'On my way.',
  'Roger.',
  "Roger.  Check back when you've activated the ship.",
  "No.. No, he's not.  He's --",
  "I'm all right, leave it!",
  "Just tell me what the fuck we're supposed to do now.  What're we gonna do now?",
  'They killed him getting it off.',
  "I'm sorry.",
  "That's because I blew it out the Goddamn airlock!",
  "Awright!  Let's knock off the grabass.  First assembly's in fifteen...let's shag it.",
  'So what are these things?',
  "It's game time.",
  "Looks like that new Lieutenant's too good to eat with us grunts.",
  'Oh God...',
  'Over there.',
  'Pull you team out, Gorman.',
  'Sweet Jesus.',
  "How about 'big weird thing'?",
  "...that's better.  Pan it around a bit.",
  "Best decision I ever made, Bill. We'll be starting a new life from scratch, in a clean world. No crime.  No unemployment...",
  'Hey, Bob!  I heard you and the family are heading off for the colonies!',
  'Hold you fire!',
  "Let's move.  Hicks, back us up.",
  'Mommy...where are you?',
  'Moooommeeee...',
  'Newt!  Star wherever you are!',
  'Rebecca.',
  "What's her name again?",
  'Yello?  Oh, Ripley.  Hi...',
  "I need some slack, man.  How come they send us straight back out like this?  We got some slack comin', man.",
  "I don't care how!  Think of a way.  Think of something.",
  "I don't get it.  It doesn't make any Goddamn sense.",
  "It's a second chance, kiddo.  And it'll be the best thing in the world for you to face this fear and beat it.  You gotta get back on the horse...",
  'Like I said.',
  "They've lost contact with the colony on Acheron.",
  'Well...she has already learned to take my promises with a grain of salt.  When it came to flight schedules, anyway.',
  '...and seal these ducts here and here.  Then they can only come at us from these two corridors and we create a free field of fire for the other two sentry units, here.',
  "I can drive that loader.  I've got a Class Two rating.  My latest career move.",
  "It'll be okay, Newt.  Dad knows what he's doing.",
  'And hope to die.',
  'Gone.',
  "I'll go.",
  "Yes, there are, aren't there.",
  "Cancer.  Hmmmm.  They still haven't licked that one.  Cremated.  Interred Parkside Repository, Little Chute, Wisconsin.  No children.",
  'Removed surgically before embryo implantation.  Subject:  Marachuk, John L.   Died during procedure.',
  "She's right.",
  'Holy shiiit!',
  "I want those specimens destroyed as soon as you're done with them. You understand?",
  'I expected more of you, Ripley. I thought you would be smarter than this.',
  "Oh, God.  Jesus.  This ain't happening.",
  'Amanda Ripley-McClaren.  Married name, I guess.  Age:  sixty-six ...at time of death.  Two years ago.',
  'Come on!',
  "Let's waste him.",
  'Gorman!  Give it a rest would you.',
  "Thanks a lot!  Now I can't hear shit.",
  'Burke!',
  'Code Blue!  415.  Code Blue! 4-1-5!',
  'Hey...hey!',
  "No!  The answer is no.  Now please go.  I'm sorry.  Just go, would you.",
  'Testing!',
  'What?',
  "What are you doing?  Turn around!  That's an order!",
  "It's all I could get.  Anyway, it keeps my mind off of... everything.  Days off are worse.",
  "Physically she's okay. Borderline malnutrition, but I don't think any permanent damage.",
  'More cornbread?',
  "Poor thing.  You don't talk much do you?  That's okay by me.  Most people do a lot of talking and they wind up not saying very much.",
  "Well, maybe you shouldn't worry about that just yet.",
  "Come on out.  It's all right...",
  "They'd be here if they could, honey.  I know they would.",
  'Pendejo jerkoff.',
  'You sent them to that ship.  I just checked the colony log... directive dates six-twelve-seventy-nine. Signed Burke, Carter J.',
  'I suggest you study the disks Ripley has been kind enough to prepare for you.',
  "Okay, let's do it.",
  "I think we'll take off and nuke the site from orbit.  It's the only way to be sure.",
  'It likes you.',
  'Looks like you company can write off its share of this colony.',
  'No offense.',
  "What about you?  What's your interest in this?",
  "You're dogmeat, pal.",
  "Are there any species like this 'hostile organism' on LV-426?",
  'Hold at forty.  Slow circle of the complex.',
  "Set down sixty meters this side of the telemetry mast.  Immediate dust off on my 'clear,' then stay on station.",
  'GET THEM OUT OF THERE!  DO IT NOW!',
  'The place is dead, Sir.  Whatever happened, we missed it.',
  "Wake up pendejo!  I'm gonna kill you, you useless fuck!",
  "What's he scanning for?",
  'Hicks, get down here.  I need that locator.',
  'We need the other drop-ship.  The on one the Sulaco.  We have to bring it down on remote, somehow.',
  'Now, if I did it right...',
  'Go!',
  'Close your eyes, baby.',
  "Let's go!",
  'You okay?',
  'Proceed inside.',
  "We're not making that out too well.  What is it?",
  "Let's get some trackers going. Come on, get moving.  Gorman, watch Burke.",
  "Let's go.",
  "No good.  How do we know it'll effect their biochemistry?  I say we take off and nuke the entire site from orbit.  It's the only way to be sure.",
  'Seal the door.',
  'Figures.',
  "It won't be necessary.",
  "He's at the up-link tower.",
  'Newt, you better go sit up front.  Go on.',
  'Where the fu --',
  "It's insured.",
  "They're but off!  Do something!",
  "...We're coming in.",
  'Anything?',
  "Bishop here.  I'm afraid I have some bad news.",
  'Dumbshit.',
  'How is he?',
  'Just get back here!',
  "Let's get the fuck out of here!",
  'Not that tunnel, the other one!',
  "They're in the approach corridor.",
  'You sure?  Watch it...behind you.  Fucking move, will you!',
  "You're just reading me.",
  "Lights are green.  She's alive. Well, there goes out salvage, guys.",
  "Negative.  We're all in Operations.",
  'B-Level.  Next one down.',
  'Flame-units only.  I want rifles slung.',
  'Forty meters in.  Ramp on axial two-two.  Access to sublevels.',
  'Looks like some sort of secreted resin.',
  'Standing by.',
  "Who's firing?  I ordered a hold fire, dammit!",
  'You tell me.  I only work here.',
  "I knew you'd come.",
  'Mommy...Mommy?',
  'Terrible.',
  "You know, Burke, I don't know which species is worse.  You don't see them screwing each other over for a fucking percentage.",
  'Newt.  Newt, wake up.',
  "Sssh.  Don't move.  We're in trouble.",
  'Talk to me, Hudson.',
  "They're dead.",
  '...then it...emerges.  Moults. Grows rapidly --',
  "I want you two walking the perimeter. I know we're all in strung out shape but stay frosty and alert. We've got to stop any entries before they get out of hand.",
  'Say again?  All after incinerators?',
  'Thanks.',
  "Apone, collect magazines from everybody.  We can't have any firing in there.",
  "The ship is on its way.  ETA about sixteen minutes.  I've got my hands full flying... the weather's come up a bit.",
  "We ain't going anywhere.",
  "Don't be long, Ellen.",
  '...lay down ...by squads to...',
  'Yes, I read you.  Not very well...',
  'I always keep this handy. For close encounter.',
  'Any movement?',
  'Half mine, dear.',
  "Knock it off!  I catch either of you playing in the air ducts again I'll tan your hides.",
  'Mayday!  Mayday!  This is Alpha Kilo Two Four Niner calling Hadley Control. Repeat.  This is...',
  "Shouldn't we call in?",
  "You kids stay inside.  I mean it!  We'll be right back.",
  'Awright!  I want a nice clean dispersal this time.',
  "Awright, let's go girls, they ain't payin' us by the hour.",
  "Awright.  Fire-team A.  Gear up. Let's move.  Two minutes. Somebody wake up Hicks.",
  'Christ.  I never saw such a buncha old women.  You want me to fetch your slippers, Hudson?',
  'Dietrich?  Crowe?  Sound off!  Wierzbowski?',
  'First squad, assemble on me at the main lock.',
  'Flame thrower!  Move!',
  'Go to infrared.  Looks sharp people!',
  "I don't know.  Is there anything you can do?",
  "Let's go.  Pull 'em out.",
  "Let's go...let's go.  Cycle through!",
  "Let's move it, girls!  On the ready line.  Let's go, let's go.",
  'Position?',
  "Rescue mission.  There's some juicy colonists' daughters we gotta rescue from virginity.",
  'Sealed.  Hudson, run a bypass.',
  "Second squad?  What's your status?",
  'Tease us a bit.',
  'Ten seconds, people.  Look sharp!',
  'Tench-hut!',
  "Vasquez, take point.  Let's move.",
  'Yeah.  Right.  Right!  Fuck the heat exchanger!',
  "You know it ain't up to me.",
  "Hard to say.  It may have been blind instinct...attraction to the heat of whatever...but she did choose to incubate her eggs in the one spot where we couldn't destroy her without destroying ",
  "ourselves.  That's if she exists, of course.",
  'I checked.  The hard wiring between here and there was severed in the fighting.',
  "I gave him a shot, for the pain. We'll need to get a stretcher to cart him up to medical.",
  "I had to circle and hope things didn't get too rough to take you off.",
  "I prefer the term 'artificial person' myself.  Is there a problem?",
  "I'll be in medical.  I'd like to continue my analysis.",
  "I'm afraid so.  The crash did too much damage.  The overload is inevitable, at this point.",
  "I'm projecting total systems failure in a little under four hours.  The blast radius will be about thirty kilometers.  About equal to ten megatons.",
  "I'm really the only one qualified to remote-pilot the ship anyway. Believe me, I'd prefer not to.  I may be synthetic but I'm not stupid.",
  "I'm shocked.  Was it an older model?",
  "I'm sorry if I gave you a scare but that platform was just becoming too unstable...",
  "I'm sorry you feel that way about Synthetics, Ripley.",
  'In seventeen minutes this place will be a cloud of vapor the size of Nebraska.',
  "I've isolated a neuro-muscular toxin responsible for the paralysis.  It seems to be metabolizing.  He should wake up soon.",
  'Mr. Burke have instructions that they were to be kept alive in stasis for return to the company labs.  He was very specific.',
  'Not bad for a human.',
  'PLENTY!  TWENTY-SIX MINUTES!',
  'Ripley...',
  'That is the question of the hour.  We could assume a parallel to certain insect forms who have hivelike organization.',
  'An ant of termite colony, for example, is ruled by a single female, a queen, which is the source of new eggs.',
  "That's it.  See it?  Emergency venting.",
  'This duct runs almost to the up-link assembly.  One hundred eighty meters.  Say, forty minutes to crawl down there.',
  'One hour to patch in and align the antenna. Thirty minutes to prep the ship, then about fifty minutes flight time.',
  'Well, thanks, I --',
  "Well, that explains it.  The A/2's were always a bit twitchy. That could never happen now with out behavioral inhibitors.",
  'Impossible for me to harm or, by omission of action, allow to be harmed a human being.',
  "Well, the queen is always physically larger then the others.  A termite queen's abdomen is so bloated with eggs that it can't move at all.",
  'It is fed and tended by drone workers, defended by the warriors.  She is the center of their lives, quite literally the  mother of their society.',
  'Yes.  That follows.',
  'A synthetic malfunctioned on her last trip out.  Some deaths were involved.',
  "All right.  My instinct says you're strong enough to handle this...Fifty-seven years.",
  'Are these the same...?',
  'Corporal Hicks!?',
  'Cyberdyne Systems 120-A/2.',
  'Hear me out...',
  'Here we go.',
  'Hi, Ripley.  This is Lieutenant Gorman of the...',
  'Hmm.  Acid for blood.',
  'I heard you were working in the cargo docks.',
  "I know, I know, but we're dealing with changing scenarios here.  This thing is major, Ripley.  I mean really major.  You gotta go with its energy.",
  'Since you are the representative of the company who discovered this species your percentage will naturally be some serious, serious money.',
  'If you go.',
  "It was a bad call, that's all.",
  'Just tell them what happened.  The important thing is to stay cool and unemotional.',
  'Look, I believe you, but there are going to be some heavyweights in there.  You got Feds, you got interstellar commerce commission, you got colonial administration, insurance company guys...',
  "Look, maybe the thing didn't even exist, right?  And if I'd made it a major security situation, the Administration would've stepped in.  Then no exclusive rights, nothing.",
  "Look, this is a multimillion dollar operation.  He can't make that kind of decision.  He's just a grunt!",
  "Look, we don't know what's going on out there.  It may just be a down transmitter.  But if it's not, I want you there...as an advisor.  That's all.",
  'Looks like my room in college.',
  "Now hold on a second.  I'm not authorizing that action.",
  'Now, wait a second --',
  'Ripley we have to talk.',
  "Ripley...help me.  I can feel it...inside.  Oh, God...it's moving!  Oh gooood...",
  'Running loaders, forklifts, that sort of thing?',
  "Sorry...I've been running behind all morning.",
  'Still nothing from the colony?',
  "That's the plan.  My word on it.",
  "These are dead.  There's just the two alive.",
  "These Colonial Marines are some tough hombres, and they're packing state-of-the-art firepower. Nothing they can't handle...right, Lieutenant?",
  'Think about it.',
  "This is absurd!  You don't have the authority to --",
  "This is clearly an important species we're dealing with here. We can't just arbitrarily exterminate them --",
  "This is total paranoid delusion. It's pitiful.",
  "Those specimens are worth millions to the bio-weapons division.  Now, if you're smart we can both come out of this heroes.  Set up for life.",
  "Uh-hunh.  One of thirty or so, all over the planet.  They're completely automated.  We manufacture them, by the way.",
  "Well, I mean...I know this is an emotional moment, but let's not make snap judgments.  Let's move cautiously.  First, this physical installation had a substantial dollar value attached to it --",
  'Well, I was going to wait until after the inquest...',
  "Well, it didn't occur to me.  It's been policy for years to have a synthetic on board.",
  "Well, the corporation co-financed that colony with the Colonial Administration, against mineral rights.  We're getting into a lot of terraforming...'Building Better Worlds.'",
  "We're talking thermonuclear explosion.",
  'What if I said I could get you reinstated as a flight officer? And that the company has agreed to pick up your contract?',
  "Yeah?  Maybe the organisms like the heat, that's why they built...",
  "Yes, and I've read it.  You wake up every night, sheets soaking, the same nightmare over and over...",
  'You had them eating out of your hand, kiddo.',
  "You'd drifted right through the core systems.  It's blind luck that deep-salvage team caught you when they...are you all right?",
  "You've been doing your homework. Look, they can't impound it if they don't know about it.",
  'Not enough to have to wake up to your face, Drake.',
  'Sir!',
  "Yeah, 'Top'...what about it?",
  "Hold her...Get me an airway, stat! And fifteen cc's of...Jesus!",
  'Suck air.  Hey, Hicks...you look like I feel.',
  "They ain't payin' us enough for this.",
  'Yo!  Vasquez.  Kick ass!',
  "No.  It's a rock.  No indigenous life larger than a simple virus.",
  "To be perfectly frank, we've surveyed over three hundred worlds and no one's ever reported a creature which, using your words...",
  'Would you just listen to yourself for one minute.',
  'Do you mind?',
  'Attention.  Attention.  Automatic fueling operations have begun. Please extinguish all smoking materials.',
  'Got it.  Rough air ahead.',
  'Initiate release sequencer on my mark.  Three.  Two.  One.  Mark!',
  "She's supposed to be some kinda consultant... (exaggerated) ...She was an alien once.",
  'Spunkmeyer?  Goddammit.',
  "Turning on final.  Coming around to a seven-zero-niner.  Terminal guidance locked in.  Where's the damn beacon?",
  'Sir, you should check this out...',
  'Clear, please.',
  'Hey, hand job, you take my towel?',
  "Hotter'n hell in here.",
  'FROST No, Sir.  Looks like it was a helluva fight.',
  'FROST Right ahead here...',
  'Alive?',
  'All right, I guess.  One hell of a hangover.  Look, Ripley... I...',
  "All right, the area's secured. Let's go in and see what their computer can tell us.",
  'All right.  I want this to go smooth and by the numbers.  I want DCS and tactical database assimilation by 0830.',
  "All we know is that there's still no contact with the colony and that a xenomorph may be involved.",
  'Are there any questions?  Hudson?',
  "At ease.  I'm sorry we didn't have time to brief before we left Gateway but...",
  "Come on, we're wasting our time.",
  'Dead on all channels.',
  'I said...',
  "Let's saddle up.",
  "Let's see.  Everybody on line. Drake, check you camera.  There seems to be a...",
  'No bodies?',
  'Now think, Rebecca. Concentrate.  Just start at the beginning...',
  'Okay, stand by in operations.',
  "PDT'S.  Personal-Data Transmitters. Every adult colonist had one surgically implanted.",
  'Quarter and search by twos.  Second team move inside.  Hicks, take the upper level.  Use your motion trackers.',
  'Ripley, what the hell...?',
  'Shit.',
  'Shut up.  Just shut up!',
  'So.',
  'They ripped apart the colony for building materials.',
  'Thirty-eight...simulated.',
  'Total brain-lock.',
  'Uh,...Apone, I want you to lay down a suppressing fire with the incinerators and fall back by squads to the APC, over.',
  "We can't see anything back here, Apone.  What's going on?",
  'Well...two.  Three, including this one.',
  'What is it?',
  "What's the question?",
  'Where are your parents?  You have to try...',
  "You can't use those in here!",
  'You still want to kill me?',
  "You wouldn't be going in with the troops.  I can guarantee your safety.",
  'About seventeen days.',
  "All right!  She's alive.  I believe it.  But we gotta get moving!  Now!",
  "All right, stand by there.  We're on out way.  Over.",
  'Are you finished?',
  "B gun's dry.  Twenty on A. Ten.  Five.  That's it.",
  'Behind us.',
  "Can't tell.  Lots.  D gun's down to twenty.  Ten.  It's out.",
  "Dwayne.  It's Dwayne.",
  "Fuckin' A!",
  'Get on the Goddamn door!',
  'Guns A and B.  Tracking and firing on multiple targets.',
  'Here, put this on.  Then I can locate you anywhere in the complex on this --',
  "He's alive.  I think he's paralyzed.",
  "He's gone!  Forget it, he's gone!",
  'Hold it.  Hold it.  Back off, right now.',
  'How long since you slept? Twenty-four hours?',
  "If it comes to that, I'll do us both.  Let's see that it doesn't Here, I'd like to introduce you to a close personal friend of mine.",
  "It's moving.",
  "It's okay...we're clear.  We're clear.  Ease up.",
  'Just a...precaution.  You know.',
  'Just let it drop right out.  Get the other one in quick.  Just slap it in hard, it likes abuse. Now, pull the bolt.',
  'Just pull it in real right.  It will kick some.  When the counter here heads zero, hit this...',
  "Let's get these things lit.",
  'Looks like a Goddamn town meeting.',
  'Looks that way.',
  'M-41A 10mm pulse-rifle, over and under with a 30mm pump-action grenade launcher.',
  'Maybe.  Maybe not.',
  'Newt time then can walk right up and knock.',
  'Nothing.  No movement.',
  "Outstanding.  Then all we need's a deck of cards.  All right, let's move like we got a purpose.",
  'Ow!  Shit.  Watchit, she bites.',
  'Poor bastard.',
  "Prep for dust-off.  We're gonna need an immediate evac.",
  'Save it.',
  "Sounds like a blown transaxle. You're just grinding metal.",
  'Stand back.',

  'You promise?',
  "All right.  I'm in.",
  "All right.  Let's get on it.  What'll you need?",

  'Just stay away from me, Bishop! You got that straight?',
  'Look, Burke.  We had an agreement.',

  "suggest you find it, using the flight recorder's data.  Find it and deal with it -- before one of your survey teams comes back with a little surprise...",

  "No, it's different, honey.",
  "No.  There's no way!",
  'No...noooo!',
  'Nothing bad in here.  Maybe you could just try to be like her.',
  'Now let me get this straight. The aliens paralyzed the colonists, carried them over there, cocooned them to be hosts for more of those...',
  'Now many?',
  "Now you just lie here and have a nap.  You're exhausted.",
  "Oh, Newt.  You mom and dad went away like that, didn't they?",
  'Oh.  Sorry, Newt.',
  "Okay.  It's important to understand this organism's life cycle.  It's actually two creatures.  The first form hatches from a spore...a sort of large egg, and attaches itself to its victim.  Then it ",

  'Right here, baby.  Right here.',
  'Run!',
  'See you, Hicks.',
  'She survived longer than that with no weapons and no training.',
  "She's alive.  They brought her here and you know it.",
  "So you better just start dealing with it.  Just deal with it, Hudson...because we need you and I'm tired of your bullshit.  Now get on a terminal and call up some kind of floor plan file. ",
  'Construction blueprints, maintenance schematics, anything that shows the layout of this place.  I want to see air ducts, electrical access tunnels, subbasements.  Every possible way into this wing.',
  'So...then the fusion containment shuts down.',
  'Sorry to disappoint you.',
  'Stay behind me.',
  'That the atmosphere processor?',
  "That's not all, Goddamnit!  If those things get back here, that will be all.  Then you can just kiss it good-bye, Jack!  Just kiss it goodbye.",
  "That's not what I mean.  Gorman, if your men have to use their weapons in there, they'll rupture the cooling system.",
  "That's right.",
  "That's right.  So we put up welded barricades at these intersections...",
  "The 'maze'?  You mean the air ducts?",
  'The only way it would work is if he sabotaged certain freezers on the trip back.  Then he could jettison the bodies and make up any story he liked.',
  'The structure seems intact.  They have power.',
  "Then somebody's gotten to it... doctored the recorder.  Who had access to it?",
  "There, there.  Sssshh.  It's all right.",
  "They can bill me.  I got a tab running.  What's second?",
  'They cut the power.',
  "They had their minds made up before I even went in there. They think I'm a head case.",
  'They learned.  They cut the power and avoided the guns.  They must have found another way in, something we missed.',
  'They retreated.  The guns stopped them.',
  "They're at the fire door.",
  "They're right on us.  Vasquez, how you doing?",
  "They're right under the primary heat exchangers.",
  'This operation is under military jurisdiction and Hicks is next in chain of command.  Right?',
  "This service tunnel is how they're moving back and forth.",
  "Uh oh.  I made a clean spot here.  Now I've done it.  Guess I'll just have to do the whole thing.",
  'Wait!  Tell him to...',
  'Watch it, Burke...',
  'We made it, Jones.  We made it.',
  "Well then somebody's just going to have to go out there.  Take a portable terminal and go out there and plug in manually.",
  "Well, Newt it is then.  My name's Ripley...and people call me Ripley.",
  "Well, some kids can't handle it like you can.",
  "We're going home, honey.",
  "WE'RE NOT LEAVING!",
  'What about me?',
  "What about the colony transmitter? That up-link tower down at the other end.  Why can't we use that?",
  'What are you talking about. What people?',
  'What did you say?',
  'What do I do?',
  'What rank?  I believe Corporal Hicks has authority here.',
  'What?',
  "What's this?",

  'Why not?',

  'Yes.  A little girl.',
  'Yes?',

  "You're saying one of those things lays all the eggs?",
