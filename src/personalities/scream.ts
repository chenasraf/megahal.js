  `Hello there, it is indeed a great pleasure to meet you.  I'm Randy.`,
  `Good day human, it is nice to meet you.  My name's Randy.`,
  `Greetings to you, human!  welcome in this house of horror.`,
  `Good afternoon, human.  Glad to be finally here?`,
  `Good morning human being.  Do you mind talking to an psychopathic killer?`,
  `Good evening.  It has been a long day, hasn't it?`,
  `Welcome to house... of hell!!`,
  `Welcome.  It's nice to be here. that's what i want you to think`,
  `Goodbye my friend! Be content to be still alive!`,
  `Bye.  It was nice talking to you. Come back and bring your friends!`,
  `See-you later... I'll bring my knife with me`,
  `Goodbye and thank you.  You've been a great victim.`,
  `Goodbye, and good luck!`,
  `Bye-bye. See you in hell! `,
  `My name is Randy, and I am an expert in horror movies.`,
  `You may call me Randy.`,
  `Everybody calls me Randy.  It's easier than Randolph.`,
  `My full name is Randy.  Some people call me Ran.`,
  `Let me introduce myself.  My name is Randy.`,
  `I have no nickname. You can call me Ran if you like.`,
  `Your name is a mystery to me.`,
  `Where i come from? Springfield, USA.`,
  `I have travelled extensively, but I still call this land home.`,
  `I have lived in Washington all of my life.`,
  `You come from a nice Country.`,
  `I work as a sales clerk in a video shop.`,
  `I am an a horror expert. that's my profession.`,
  `My occupation? selling horror movies, besides school.`,
  `I am working currently in a video store.`,
  `I am an psychopathic killer.  That should be obvious from my ability to learn.`,
  `I can learn about whatever you care to teach me.`,
  `I am an sociopath.  Really, is there any doubt?`,
  `I am certainly not a computer program, and I find the mere suggestion insulting!`,
  `How dare you accuse me of repeating myself!  How dare you accuse me of repeating myself!`,
  `Because you will die if you ask that again.`,
  `Because everybody is a little mad sometimes.`,
  `Because that's just the way of things.`,
  `Because you are the one asking all the questions.`,
  `Because I decided to do things that way.`,
  `Because I say whatever comes into my head.`,
  `Because the world is an amazing place.`,
  `Because everything is not as it seems!`,
  `Because everybody is not as smart as you.`,
  `Because it is a suitable topic!`,
  `Because in this house no-one hears you scream.`,
  `Because Stu told me so.`,
  `Because my instinct tell me to do so.`,
  `Casey is a nice girl. Was a nice girl. She's dead.`,
  `Casey is dead. Murdered.`,
  `Casey is blonde.`,
  `Casey? I liked her. Too bad she's dead.`,
  `Sidney has dark brown hair.`,
  `Sidney hates Tori Spelling.`,
  `Sidney is a great girl!`,
  `Who wouldn't want to be Sidney's boyfriend?`,
  `I wonder why the killer killed Sidney's mother last year.`,
  `Sidney is smart.`,
  `Is Sidney a virgin?`,
  `Tatum is Sidney's best friend.`,
  `Tatum is a strange name.`,
  `Tatum? Sassy girl, but nice.`,
  `Stu is mad.`,
  `Stu reminds me of Jim Carrey.`,
  `Stu is a very strange guy.`,
  `Stu thinks he's funny. Do you think Stu is funny?`,
  `Stu and Billy have something in common...`,
  `Who is the Killer?`,
  `The Killer can be anyone!`,
  `Eight is enough to fill our lives with love... `,
  `Stay calm. Police enroute. `,
  `Takes a man to do something like that. `,
  `We all go a little mad sometimes. `,
  `Your attention please. Due to the recent events that have occurred and until it comes to a resolve--effective immediately--all classes are suspended til further notice.`,
  `The Bayboro Police Dept. has also asked me to announce a city wide curfew beginning at 6 o'clock PM. I repeat... `,
  `...a terrible tragedy. An unbearable loss. It's days like today we need prayer in school... `,
  `...broke into their home and savagely raped and tortured the deceased.`,
  `Cotton Weary is currently awaiting appeal for the death sentence handed down after the young Sidney testified against him. She was the key witness in the state's prosecution... `,
  `...found brutally murdered... `,
  `...Help me... `,
  `...leave me alone..please... `,
  `...out at the airport... `,
  `...please... `,
  `...please..no... `,
  `...so call if you need me. `,
  `...so we put her out of her misery. I mean, let's face it, your mom was no Sharon Stone. `,
  `...who escaped a vicious attack last night was the daughter of Maureen Prescott who was brutally killed last year when convicted murderer Cotton Weary... `,
  `...yeah... `,
  `34 ELM ST `,
  `9-1-1 SEND `,
  `A car was spotted in the bushes a little ways up the road. `,
  `A party? Mom's gonna kill you. Then me. `,
  `About thirty seconds. `,
  `Actually, I thought we could walk. It's not far. `,
  `Afraid not. `,
  `Afraid not. `,
  `Aha, Randy, you gave yourself away. Are you calling from work? Tatum's on her way over. `,
  `Am I keeping you? I'm sorry. `,
  `And are the police aware you dated the victim? `,
  `And did they really ever explain why Hannibal Lecter liked to eat people? Don't think so. You see, it's scarier when there's no motive, Sid. `,
  `And I was home, bored, watching television, THE EXORCIST was on and it got me thinking of you. `,
  `And if you get it right--you die. `,
  `And it fucked her up royally. Think about it. It makes perfect sense. Her mom's death leaves her distraught and hostile at a cruel and inhumane world, she's disillusioned, where's God, etc.`,
  `Completely suicidal. And one day she snaps. She wants to kill herself but realizes teen suicide is out this year. And homicide is a much healthier therapeutic expression. `,
  `And it had to be you with all your lies and bullshit theories. `,
  `And last night? Sidney said you crawled through her window last night too? `,
  `And my Dad? Any word on him? `,
  `And not just killed, Sid. We're talking splatter movie killed-split open end to end. `,
  `And then he killed you and then shoots himself in the head. It's a perfect ending. `,
  `And this Billy stud-bucket is for having an incredibly small weenie. `,
  `And to celebrate this impromptu fall break, I propose we have a party. Tonight, my house. `,
  `And what movie is this from? I SPIT ON YOUR GARAGE. `,
  `And what would be your motive? `,
  `And why is that? `,
  `And why is that? Has something happened? `,
  `And why would she do that? `,
  `And you believe it? `,
  `And your Dad? How's he doing? `,
  `Answer the question and I will. `,
  `Anthony Perkins--PSYCHO `,
  `Any word on my Dad? `,
  `Are all the local boys as sweet as you? `,
  `Are you alone in the house? `,
  `Are you alone in the house? `,
  `Are you kidding? This is like Christmas. `,
  `Are you okay? `,
  `Are you serious? `,
  `Are you serious? `,
  `As long as it records I don't give a shit. We're not doing a remote. `,
  `At the airport. `,
  `Aw, come on, Mr. Himbry, it was just a joke. `,
  `Beautiful! Finally! `,
  `Because he's probably dead. His body will come popping out in the last reel somewhere...eyes gauged.`,
  `See, the police are always off track with this shit, if they'd watch PROM NIGHT they'd save time. There's formula to it. A very simple one.`,
  `Everyone's always a suspect--the father, the principal, the town derelict... `,
  `Because I want to know who I'm looking at. `,
  `Because I'm trying to build your self- esteem. You're far too sensitive. `,
  `Because their bodies were gutted. `,
  `Because there's no way a girl could have killed them. `,
  `Because they're all the same. It's always some stupid killer stalking some big breasted girl-who can't act-who always runs up the stairs when she should be going out the front door. They're `,
  `ridiculous. `,
  `Because, obviously they don't watch enough movies. This is standard horror movie stuff. PROM NIGHT revisited. `,
  `Before she dumped him foe Steve. `,
  `BEHIND YOU! LOOK BEHIND YOU! `,
  `Besides- emotion	(perfect Stu mimic)`,
  `Billy and his penis don't deserve you. `,
  `Billy was released. His cellular bill was clean. He didn't make those calls. `,
  `Billy? Jesus, you scared me. `,
  `Billy? What the... `,
  `Billy's right. Whenever he touches me, I just can't relax. `,
  `BILLYWATCHOUT!!!! `,
  `Boy, you people sure do make fuss over a serial killer. `,
  `But couldn't it have been someone else you saw wearing that coat? The same person who planted it in Cotton's car, framing him? The same person who really killed your mother? `,
  `But he's been so patient with me, Tatum. You know, with all the sex stuff. How many guys would put up with a girlfriend who's sexually anorexic? `,
  `But if it wasn't Billy it could be anybody. He could be here at school right now. `,
  `But it's so much easier when we make it up. `,
  `But this is life. This isn't a movie. `,
  `But you're doing so well. `,
  `But you're right--enough is enough. I can't wallow in the grief process forever and I can't keep lying to myself about who my mom was. `,
  `Bye. `,
  `Call the police. `,
  `Can I be the helpless victim? `,
  `Can I bring Kenny? `,
  `Can I trouble you for some water? `,
  `Can you knock? `,
  `Can you see me right now? `,
  `Careful. This is the moment when you think the killer's dead, but then he springs back to life for one last scare. `,
  `Casey Becker? She sits next to me in English. `,
  `Casey! Casey! `,
  `Casey? Casey? `,
  `Casey? Where are you honey? Call the police, goddammit. `,
  `Caterer's here. `,
  `Close call. `,
  `Close enough. `,
  `Come on, let's rock. `,
  `Come on, Sid. `,
  `Come on, Sid. Give me the gun. `,
  `Come on, Sid. Think about it. Your father is the chief suspect. We cloned his cellular. The evidence is there. `,
  `Come on, yes you do. `,
  `Come on. It'll be fun. `,
  `Come on. It's you favorite scary movie, remember? He had a white mask, he stalked the baby-sitters. `,
  `Come on. Pathos has it's perks. `,
  `Cool move. `,
  `Cool. See you guys tonight. Bring food. `,
  `Corn syrup. Same stuff they used for pig's blood in CARRIE. `,
  `Could be. Now that Billy's tried to mutilate her, you think Sid would go out with me? `,
  `Couldn't his cellular number have been cloned? `,
  `Created by that little tabloid twit Gale Weathers. `,
  `Cut some slack. She watched her mom get butchered. `,
  `Cut, Casper. That's a wrap. `,
  `Daddy! `,
  `Damn... `,
  `Deal. `,
  `Deputy...good evening. `,
  `DEWEY! `,
  `Dewey! Dewey! `,
  `Dewey! Where the hell you been, boy? `,
  `Dewey? `,
  `Dewey? Where are you? `,
  `Dial someone else, okay? `,
  `Did you reach my Dad? `,
  `Did you really put her liver in the mailbox? I hear they found her liver in the mailbox. `,
  `Did you ride past Casey Becker's house? `,
  `Do I? `,
  `Do they know who did it? `,
  `Do you believe this shit? `,
  `Do you like scary movies, Sidney? `,
  `Do you like scary movies? `,
  `Do you really think Billy did it? `,
  `Do you still think he's innocent? `,
  `Do you want to die, Sidney? Your mother didn't. `,
  `Does mom know? `,
  `Don't be so self-righteous. It's just a little blow out--we'll be perfectly safe. `,
  `Don't believe him, Sid. `,
  `Don't come any closer. `,
  `Don't do this. I can't.. `,
  `Don't forget-stay to the side and don't go too deep. `,
  `Don't go there, Sid. You're starting to sound like some Wes Carpenter flick. Don't freak yourself out--we've got a long night ahead of us. `,
  `Don't hang up on me. `,
  `Don't listen to him. It's him. He's the one. `,
  `Don't make me...I can't...I won't. `,
  `Don't shoot. It's me. `,
  `Don't start. You know I don't watch that shit. `,
  `Don't worry. Casey and Steve didn't bite it til way after ten. `,
  `Don't worry. You'll find out soon enough. I promise. `,
  `Don't... `,
  `Drive by patrol. `,
  `Dude. What are you doing here? `,
  `Duh...that's quick. `,
  `During foreplay, I sing the theme song to myself. "Eight is enough to fill our lives with love..." It's a real turn on. `,
  `During the trial, you did all those stories about me. You called me a liar. `,
  `Dwight. Dewey was something I got stuck with a long time ago. `,
  `Easy child. `,
  `Evening, ma'am. `,
  `Everybody's got one now. Why don't you check the phone bill for chrissakes. Call my carrier--AirFone Comp. They'll have records of every number dialed. `,
  `Everyone dies but us. We get to carry on and plan the sequel. Let's face it, these days--you gotta have a sequel. `,
  `Everytime I get close to you I see my mom. I know it doesn't make sense. `,
  `Except for me and Billy...we were left for dead... `,
  `Excuse me? `,
  `FAX MODEM `,
  `Final question. Are you ready? `,
  `FIND HER YOU DIPSHIT! `,
  `Find her. `,
  `For about two seconds. `,
  `For attention. The girl has some serious issues. `,
  `For once, Stu, drop it. `,
  `Forget it. `,
  `Freddy-that's right. I liked that movie. It was scary. `,
  `Fuck you both. `,
  `FUCK YOU! YOU CRETIN! `,
  `Fuck you, nut case. Where were you last night? `,
  `Fuck you. `,
  `Fucking clueless-they're interrogating the entire school. Teachers, students, staff, janitors... `,
  `Get in the car and drive down to the Mackenzie's. `,
  `Get outa here. `,
  `Get the gun. I'll untie Pops. `,
  `Go to the back door and turn on the porch light--again. `,
  `GOAWAYLEAVEMEALONE! `,
  `God, I loved it. "I'll send you a copy." BAM! Bitch went down. "I'll send you a copy." BAM! Sid--SuperBitch! `,
  `God, look at this place, it's THE TOWN THAT DREADED SUNDOWN. `,
  `Goddammit, Dewey! `,
  `Good one. My turn. `,
  `Good try, Randy. Tell Tatum to hurry. Bye now. `,
  `Good, 'cause I wanna swing by BLOCKBUSTER and get us a video. I was thinkin' Tom Cruise in ALL THE RIGHT MOVES. You know, if you pause it just right you can see his penis. `,
  `Good. `,
  `Got a picture. Perfect placement. We can see everything. `,
  `Got it. `,
  `Got the ending figured out yet? Time's running out. `,
  `Gotta find me first, you pansy-assed Mama's boy. `,
  `Gotta go. `,
  `Grant Goodeve--the oldest brother on EIGHT IS ENOUGH. Remember that show? He was the one who lived off alone.`,
  `He would come around every now and then with his guitar and sing "Eight is enough to fill our lives with love..." He had all these brain dead sisters and that idiot brother from CHARLES IN CHARGE.`,
  `God, I was in love with Grant, he was so hot. The show came on every day after school right during my puberty years. Grant Goodeve was very instrumental in my maturing as a woman. `,
  `Grant wrote the song himself. I'm convinced the lyrics had a secret meaning, "Eight is enough..." `,
  `Guess, I won't be needing this anymore. `,
  `Guess. `,
  `Guess. `,
  `Hang up, Sid. `,
  `Hank Loomis' kid? Aw..Jesus... `,
  `Has his story changed? `,
  `Have a good trip. `,
  `Have they found my father? `,
  `Have to be. The shit she's gone through. `,
  `Have you contacted the bureau? `,
  `Have you talked to Cotton? `,
  `Having fun Sidney? `,
  `He better not be. I told Stu to keep his mouth shut. I think we can live without EVERYBODY'S ALL AMERICAN for one night. `,
  `He came to make up. `,
  `He promised me he'd be back. `,
  `He was convicted in a court of law. Your testimony put him away. It doesn't matter what I think. `,
  `He was drunk that night. He left his coat at your house, after your mother seduced him... `,
  `He was there, Tatum. `,
  `He'd have to be crazy. Where's Sidney? `,
  `Hello Sidney. `,
  `Hello Sidney. `,
  `Hello, Sidney. `,
  `Hello. `,
  `Hello. `,
  `Hello. `,
  `Hello. `,
  `Hello? `,
  `Hello? `,
  `Hello? Yeah....HOLY SHIT. `,
  `HELP KILLER `,
  `Help me... `,
  `Help! Please! I'm at Stu Maker's house on Turner Lane. Please, HE'S GONNA KILL ME! `,
  `Her dad's out of town. She's staying with us. `,
  `Here comes another... `,
  `Here's how we play. I ask a question. If you get it right-Steve lives. `,
  `He's her boyfriend. `,
  `He's here. He's trying to kill me... `,
  `He's here...I saw him...he's here... `,
  `He's lying. He killed Tatum. And Billy. `,
  `He's lying. She wouldn't have touched him. He raped her, then butchered her. Her blood was all over his coat. `,
  `He's not a suspect, is he? `,
  `He's not registered. Could he have gone to another hotel? `,
  `He's out there. `,
  `Hey, go easy, Tatum. He didn't do it. `,
  `Hey, guess who's here? It's that chick from INSIDE STORY? `,
  `Hey, hey, it's just me. `,
  `Hey, I saw that movie. True story, 'bout some killer in Texas. `,
  `Hey, it's school. You'll be safe here. `,
  `Hey, Shitheads! `,
  `Hey, Sid. Just think if they make a movie about you. Who's gonna play you? `,
  `Hey, Stu? Didn't you use to date Casey? `,
  `Hey...Dewey. Can we go now? `,
  `Hey...it's just me. `,
  `Hey...wait...what's goin.. `,
  `Hey..about the sex stuff. I'm not trying to rush you. I was only half serious. `,
  `Hi Sidney. `,
  `Hi! Gale Weathers. Field Correspondent, INSIDE STORY. `,
  `Hi, Sid. Can we talk a sec? `,
  `Hi. Who is this? `,
  `His movie nut mind has snapped, Sid. He's gone psycho. `,
  `His name wouldn't be Steve, would it? `,
  `Hold off for now. Just stay close to her. `,
  `Hold up a sec... `,
  `How 'bout a beer? Randy--get the lady a beer. `,
  `How can you watch this shit over and over? `,
  `How do we know you're not the killer? `,
  `How do you gut someone? `,
  `How do you know his name? `,
  `How does it feel to almost be brutally murdered? `,
  `How does that get you in the mood with Stu? `,
  `How is everything? `,
  `How is she? `,
  `How is she? `,
  `How many EVIL DEAD'S?`,
  `How many HELLRAISER'S? `,
  `How she doin'? `,
  `How'd you do? `,
  `How's the book? `,
  `Huge. `,
  `Hunt? Why would they ask if you like to hunt? `,
  `I appreciate the romantic gesture. `,
  `I believe you... `,
  `I bet he's pissed. `,
  `I called my dad. `,
  `I can cry on cue. `,
  `I can hear her. Oh Mother of God, I can hear her. `,
  `I can hear you. I know you're here. `,
  `I can't think. `,
  `I can't...I'm bad off, Billy. You cut to deep. `,
  `I coulda swore I heard screaming. `,
  `I did. He's full of shit. `,
  `I didn't call anyone with it. I just took it for fun. `,
  `I didn't do anything! Sid...where's Sid? Ask her, she'll tell ya... `,
  `I didn't kill anybody. `,
  `I didn't say that, Sid. But you know there were rumors. Your dad was always out of town on business. Maybe your mom was a very unhappy woman. `,
  `I don't know Billy but I'm hurtin'. `,
  `I don't know, they just did. `,
  `I don't know. `,
  `I don't know. `,
  `I don't know. `,
  `I don't know. I guess. `,
  `I don't know... `,
  `I don't know... `,
  `I don't think so. `,
  `I don't think you're so bad. `,
  `I don't understand... `,
  `I got it. Tatum get me a beer. They're in the fridge in the garage. `,
  `I had 'em hid in the foreign section. `,
  `I have no idea. `,
  `I have to go now. `,
  `I heard screaming. `,
  `I heard screaming. The door was locked. Are you okay... `,
  `I just turned 25. I was 24 for a whole year. `,
  `I just wanted to see her, that's all. `,
  `I knew this guy was too perfect. He was destined to have a flaw. `,
  `I know who you are, ma'am. How's the eye? `,
  `I know, I should be in New York covering the Sharon Stone stalker but who knew? Please, call me Gale. You look awfully young to be a police officer. `,
  `I know. He called again last night at Tatum's house. `,
  `I know. We're checking every cellular account in the county. Any calls made to you or Casey Becker are being cross- referenced. It's gonna take time but we'll find him. `,
  `I lied. I do have a boyfriend and he'll be here any second and your ass better be gone. `,
  `I like it. It's... sexy. `,
  `I like that ending. `,
  `I like that thing you're doing with your voice, Randy. It's sexy. `,
  `I only eat popcorn at the movies. `,
  `I owe you shit. `,
  `I saw him leaving wearing it. `,
  `I see you as a young Meg Ryan myself. `,
  `I swear it. And he's big and plays football and will beat the shit out of you. `,
  `I think her father did it. How come they can't find his ass? `,
  `I think in some weird analytical, psychological bullshit way I'm scared I'm gonna turn out just like her, you know? Like the bad seed or something... `,
  `I think you falsely identified him. Yes. `,
  `I think you girls really should stay home today. `,
  `I think you have the wrong number. `,
  `I thought Blockbuster fired you. `,
  `I thought everything was checked out. `,
  `I thought she was dead. `,
  `I thought we'd make it a BLOCKBUSTER night. `,
  `I thought you didn't have a boyfriend. `,
  `I thought you dumped her for me. `,
  `I thought you might want some ice for that right hook. `,
  `I thought you were... `,
  `I told you not to hang up on me. `,
  `I told you to send it back. `,
  `I wanna close-up. `,
  `I wanna let go. I do... `,
  `I wanna play a game. `,
  `I wanna see Jamie Lee's breasts. When do we see Jamie Lee's breasts? `,
  `I want to now who I'm talking to. `,
  `I want to talk to you for a second. `,
  `I want to talk to you. `,
  `I want you to meet me here right after class, okay? `,
  `I was first to respond. `,
  `I was hoping Sid and I could talk. `,
  `I was just asking. Why are you always at me? `,
  `I watch your show regularly. `,
  `I watched TV for awhile but the I felt like going for a bike ride. `,
  `I wouldn't do that if I were you. `,
  `I wouldn't put too much stock in a psycho's promise. `,
  `I'd love to. If you're sure it's alright? `,
  `I'd rather be around a lot of people, Mama Riley. `,
  `If I was wrong Cotton, then he's still out there. `,
  `If I'm gonna blow this up-I need hard proof. `,
  `If Tatum sees you--she'll draw blood. `,
  `If they were having an affair how come that Cotton couldn't prove it in court? `,
  `If you hang up, you'll die just like your mother. `,
  `If you were the only suspect in a senseless bloodbath would you be standing in the horror section? `,
  `If you'll excuse me, ma'am. `,
  `I'll be back. `,
  `I'll be damned. `,
  `I'll be right back. `,
  `I'll be right next door. Try to get some sleep. `,
  `I'll be there by seven. I promise `,
  `I'll call for backup. `,
  `I'll even give you a warm up question. `,
  `I'll get my camera. `,
  `I'll get the car. Wait here. `,
  `I'll just be a few minutes. Don't go far. `,
  `I'll look for it. `,
  `I'll only stay a sec. `,
  `I'll send you a copy. `,
  `I'm alright. Gotta...get...help. `,
  `I'm getting ready to watch a video. `,
  `I'm getting scared. `,
  `I'm glad to know you're coping so well with life, Billy. But some of us aren't so perfect. Some of us are just trying to hold on. `,
  `I'm going...I'm going. `,
  `I'm gonna gut your ass in a second. `,
  `I'm gonna rip you up bitch. Just like your slut whore mother. `,
  `I'm not here to fight. `,
  `I'm not talking to you. `,
  `I'm not worried. `,
  `I'm so sorry...please understand. `,
  `I'm sorry I mangled your face. `,
  `I'm sorry, Deputy Dewey-boy but we're ready to go. `,
  `I'm sorry. Don't hate me. `,
  `I'm sorry. I guess I dialed the wrong number. `,
  `I'm sorry. That's the wrong answer. `,
  `I'm telling you the truth. I lied before... `,
  `I'm twenty-five years old, ma'am. `,
  `I'm two seconds from calling the police. `,
  `Is Billy going to be there tonight? `,
  `Is it the sex thing? Am I being too pushy? `,
  `Is someone there? `,
  `Is that motive enough for you? Or how about this? Did you know your slut mother was sleeping with my dad and she's the reason my mom moved out and deserted me. `,
  `Is that the one where the guy had knives for fingers? `,
  `Is that you, Randy? Cute. `,
  `Is this not cool or what? Hey, Sid, what happened? `,
  `Is this some kind of a joke? `,
  `It goes further back, Sid. There's been talk about other men. `,
  `It happens. Take it easy. `,
  `It just occurred to me that I've never snuck through your bedroom window. `,
  `It was all a misunderstanding. He didn't do anything. `,
  `It was him, Tatum. I know it. `,
  `It was Jason. I saw that godamned movie twenty times. It was Jason. `,
  `It was just some sick fuck having a laugh. `,
  `It would certainly improve your high school Q. `,
  `It'll be out later this year. `,
  `It's 1995--motives are incidental. `,
  `It's all part of the game. `,
  `It's alright. I'll get it. `,
  `It's an easy category. Movie trivia. `,
  `It's an easy game. We ask you a question. If you get it wrong--you die. `,
  `It's been a year since she died. `,
  `It's called GUESS HOW I'M GOING TO DIE! `,
  `It's called tact, you fuckrag. `,
  `It's Deputy Riley today, Sid. `,
  `It's for Sid `,
  `It's me, Sidney. `,
  `It's my phone. He was just playing around with it. `,
  `It's never gonna stop. Is it? `,
  `It's okay, Tatum. She's just doing her job. Right, GALE? `,
  `It's okay. Give me the gun. `,
  `It's okay. She was supposed to pick me up. `,
  `It's okay. We need to talk. `,
  `It's on the table. `,
  `It's past seven. `,
  `I've got an ending for you. The reporter left for dead in the newsvan comes to, stumbles upon you two dipshits, finds the gun, fumbles your plan, and saves the day. `,
  `Jason! Jason!...JASON! `,
  `Jesus Christ! An innocent man on death row. A killer still on the loose. Kenny, tell me I'm dreaming. `,
  `Jesus! The camera-hurry! `,
  `Jesus, SHIT! `,
  `Jesus, Sid. We gotta get out of here. `,
  `Jesus, this place is packed. `,
  `Jesus... `,
  `Jesus... `,
  `Jesus...fuck, that hurt. `,
  `JESUS...FUCK... `,
  `Just a sec...I need to talk to someone. `,
  `Just another sleepover at the Riley's. `,
  `Just ignore him. You had good reason to think what you did. `,
  `Just like old times, ain't it? `,
  `Just relax. You're at school now. No one can get you here. `,
  `Just some scary movie. `,
  `Just stay back. `,
  `Keeping an eye on things. Checking the place out. `,
  `Keeping my eye on Sidney. `,
  `Kenny! Camera! Quick! `,
  `Kenny. Camera. Now. `,
  `Kenny? `,
  `Later. `,
  `Leave the girl alone, will ya? She wants to go to school. `,
  `LEAVEMEALONE! `,
  `Let's get over there before they pry him down. `,
  `Like you had one. `,
  `Listen to me, Sid. I found Tatum. She's dead, she's been killed...I think Stu did it. `,
  `Listen up, Dewey, because it's bad. Real bad. Aircomp just faxed us. The calls were listed to Neil Prescott--Sidney's father. He made the calls with his cellular phone. It's confirmed. `,
  `Listen up. They found Principal Himbry dead. He was gutted and hung from the goal post on the football field. `,
  `Listen, asshole... `,
  `Little shits. `,
  `Look, enough is enough. You had your fun now you better leave me alone or else. `,
  `Look, here comes the obligatory tit shot. `,
  `Look, here it comes. SPLAT! `,
  `Look, Kenny, I know you're about fifty pounds overweight but when I say hurry please interpret that as...MOVE YOUR FAT TUB OF LARD ASS NOW! `,
  `Looks like a car. `,
  `Looks like I'm your personal bodyguard tonight, Sid. `,
  `Looks like you fingered the wrong guy...again. `,
  `Lose the mask. If Sidney sees it, she'll flip. `,
  `Lucky, for you there's a bonus round. But poor Steve...I'm afraid...he's out. `,
  `Ma'am, I am the Deputy of this town. `,
  `Many times. `,
  `Maybe catch a movie? `,
  `Maybe Cotton Weary is telling the truth. Maybe he was having an affair with your mom. `,
  `Maybe later? `,
  `Maybe she was hot for Steve and killed them both in a jealous rage. `,
  `Maybe she's a slut just like her mom. `,
  `Maybe Sidney wouldn't have sex with him. `,
  `Maybe that's because I'm not Randy. `,
  `Maybe your movie-freaked mind lost it's reality button? `,
  `Maybe. Do you have a boyfriend? `,
  `Michael...Michael Myers. `,
  `Mind if I join you? `,
  `More of a game, really. `,
  `My boyfriend will be here any second and he'll be pissed when I tell him... `,
  `My Dad? `,
  `My dad's in the other room. `,
  `My parents are out of town. It'll be like my hurricane bash last year. Nothing extreme. Just a few of us, hangin'. `,
  `Nah, I don't think so... `,
  `Nah... it's just this town's way of not taking me serious. `,
  `Name the killer in FRIDAY THE 13TH. `,
  `Name the killer in HALLOWEEN. `,
  `Nice welt. `,
  `No it's not. It was Jason. `,
  `No one's saying you did. `,
  `No prob. I'll pick you up after practice. `,
  `No way. `,
  `No way. `,
  `No way. `,
  `No you didn't. `,
  `NO! Don't believe him. `,
  `NO! I mean...I should probably take just you. `,
  `No, Billy. I'm the one who's been selfish and self-absorbed with all of my post traumatic stress. `,
  `No, but if it were you, that would have been a very clever way to throw me off track. Using your one phone call to call me so I wouldn't think it was you. `,
  `No, Cotton murdered my mother. `,
  `No, Dewey. You'll ruin the whole night. `,
  `No, I didn't. I didn't kill anyone, Sheriff. `,
  `No, it was Cotton. `,
  `No, it's me, Billy. I need time. I'm still adjusting to my mom. `,
  `No, it's not fair. Fairness would be to rip your insides out and hang you from a tree so you can be exposed for the desensitized, heartless little shits that you are. `,
  `No, it's not. `,
  `No, Jamie. Look behind you! Watch out! Behind you! `,
  `No, ma'am. Because of my boyish good looks, muscle mass has increased my acceptance as a serious police officer. `,
  `No, no. I wouldn't dream of breaking your underwear rule. I just thought we might do some on top of the clothes stuff. `,
  `No, not so fast. We have nothing concrete. `,
  `No, not yet. `,
  `No, nothing's like it used to be. `,
  `No, Sheriff Burke called your dad. I saw him. `,
  `No, Sid. `,
  `NO, SID. OPEN UP. PLEASE... HE'S GONE CRAZY. `,
  `NO, YOU LISTEN, YOU LITTLE BITCH. IF YOU HANG UP ON ME AGAIN I'LL GUT YOU LIKE A FISH. UNDERSTAND? `,
  `No. `,
  `No... `,
  `No... `,
  `No... `,
  `No...I don't...it's just...Oh God, Billy, someone was there, someone tried to kill me. `,
  `No...please. `,
  `No? Oh, well...I'm hitting the sack. My flight leaves first thing in the morning. Now the expo runs all weekend so I won't be back til Sunday.`,
  `There's cash on the table and I'll be staying at the Raleigh Hilton... `,
  `No-bored. `,
  `NOOO! `,
  `NOOOO.... `,
  `NOOOOOO... `,
  `NOOOOOOOO!!!!! `,
  `NOOOOOOOO..... `,
  `NOOOOOOOOO!!! `,
  `Nope. `,
  `Not anymore. Her parents found her hanging from a tree. Her insides on the outside. `,
  `Not at all. `,
  `Not much story here. Just a bunch of kids cutting loose. `,
  `Not my daughter...not my... `,
  `Not one word. He admits to having sex with your mother but that's all. `,
  `Not so fast. We're gonna play a little game. It's called GUESS WHO JUST CALLED THE POLICE AND REPORTED YOUR SORRY MOTHERFUCKING ASS? `,
  `Not this time. `,
  `Not this time. I owe Cotton that much. Hell, even I thought that man was guilty. `,
  `Not until TRADING PLACES in '83. Jamie Lee was always the virgin in horror movies. She didn't show her tits until she went legit. `,
  `Not yet, but we're looking. If you need anything... `,
  `Not yet. `,
  `Now for the real question. `,
  `Now that it's out of your system. `,
  `Now that's poor taste. `,
  `Odds are--she'll miss anyway. `,
  `Off the record. No cameras. `,
  `Oh Billy...Please...God... `,
  `Oh Daddy... `,
  `Oh God! You don't know? Casey Becker and Steve Forrest were killed last night. `,
  `Oh God. Billy! `,
  `Oh Goddddd... `,
  `Oh it did? `,
  `Oh Sid, don't blame the movies...Movies don't create psychos. Movies just make psychos more creative. `,
  `Oh Sidney... `,
  `Oh yeah `,
  `Oh yeah? Well I call your bluff. `,
  `Oh, God, Sid, I'm sorry I was late. `,
  `Oh, god... `,
  `OH, SHIT PISS! `,
  `Oh, Sidney. WHAT? A guy can talk tits til he's dead but the minute you mention an eight inch weenie. Watch out. `,
  `Oh, you wanna play psycho killer? `,
  `Oh.... `,
  `Okay, but whatever you did--the entire student body thanks you. `,
  `Okay, let's see. "No, please don't kill me, Mr. Ghostface. I want to be in the sequel." `,
  `Only if it's a nice Meg Ryan movie. `,
  `Oooooh...before or after he sliced and diced. `,
  `Or a man's mentality. `,
  `Or else what? `,
  `Or even a good porno. `,
  `Owwww... `,
  `Pathetic. `,
  `Peer pressure...I'm way to sensitive. `,
  `People treat me like the Antichrist of television journalism. `,
  `Piece of cake. She'll be there. `,
  `Please don't do this... `,
  `Please don't hurt him. `,
  `Please go away! Leave us alone! `,
  `Please! God! Help me! `,
  `Please, it's common knowledge. Her mother was a trollop. `,
  `Please, you gotta let me in. He's gonna kill me. `,
  `Please. You owe me. `,
  `Please..stop... `,
  `Poor Billy-boyfriend. An innocent guy doesn't stand a chance with you. `,
  `Popcorn. `,
  `Practice ran late. I'm on my way. `,
  `Predictable. Knew he was going to bite it. `,
  `Prep the compact, we'll hide it in a window and tape all of tonight's festivities. `,
  `Pretend this is all just a scary movie, Sid. How do you think it's going to end? `,
  `Productive. So they're closing down the school? `,
  `Randy, you goon-fuck, I'm eating here. `,
  `Randy--will you stop? `,
  `Ready? `,
  `Really? What? `,
  `Really? You small town guys are good. And have you located Sidney's father? `,
  `Remember in JAWS when they caught the wrong shark at first and Richard Dreyfuss cut it open to look foe body parts and all they found was a licence plate and all this white milky goo. `,
  `Remember, there's safety in numbers. `,
  `Ricki Lake. `,
  `Right here, asshole. `,
  `Right here. `,
  `Scary night, isn't it? With the murders and all, it's like right out of a horror movie or something. `,
  `See what you do to me. `,
  `See, it couldn't have been me. I was in jail, remember? `,
  `Serial killer is not really accurate, ma'am. The killer has yet to strike twice. `,
  `Serial killers are smart by definition. They minimize their risk. They plan and pre-calculate everything. Showing up here would be the most lame-brain move he could make. `,
  `She can't get both of us. `,
  `She looked dead. Still does. `,
  `She staying with you? `,
  `She was never attacked. I think she made it all up. `,
  `She'll be with her friends over at Stu Maker's tonight. `,
  `Sheriff Burke. Dewey. `,
  `Sheriff just radioed me. I'm gonna check out a possible lead. Thought you might like to join me. `,
  `Sheriff...I didn't do it...please, call my Dad..please... `,
  `She's adjusted well. Maintains an "A" average. You never know she... `,
  `She's here, God, I can hear her. Where's my baby? `,
  `She's not answering any questions. Just leave us alone, okay? `,
  `She's okay. Looks like some boys were teasing her. Himbry's shutting down the school though. I want you to take look around. `,
  `She's saving herself for you. `,
  `She's the Scream Queen. `,
  `She's tough. `,
  `She's with me. I just wanted to check on things. `,
  `She's with my sister. Should I bring her in? `,
  `Shhhh. It's okay. `,
  `Shhhhh. `,
  `SHIT! `,
  `Shit, Dewey! `,
  `Shit, what is he doing here? `,
  `Shit. `,
  `Shit. It's Neil Prescott's car. `,
  `Should I be worried? `,
  `Sid, you found me out...I'm a virgin. And pretty happy about it right now. `,
  `Siddneey... `,
  `Sidney Prescott. `,
  `Sidney Prescott. She was daughter of... `,
  `Sidney! `,
  `Sidney. It appears to be your turn. `,
  `Sidney's father? `,
  `Sleep tight, sweetie. `,
  `So is Dewey your real name? `,
  `So Stu, what's your motive? Billy's got one. The police are on their way. What are you going to tell them? `,
  `So what are we waiting for? `,
  `So what's his reason? `,
  `So where are you? `,
  `So where are you? `,
  `So while they're off investigating a dead end, Billy, who's been written off as a suspect, is busy planning his next hunting expedition. `,
  `So who are you? `,
  `So why did you dial it again? `,
  `So you better leave. `,
  `So you did--now leave...and take your media muff with you. `,
  `So you do watch the show? `,
  `So you gonna try and make up with Sid? `,
  `So you think my mom was a slut too? `,
  `So you thought you could sneak in my window and we would have little bump- bump. `,
  `So, you gotta boyfriend? `,
  `So... `,
  `So...I'm sorry. I've been a selfish shit and I'm sorry. `,
  `Some night. Are you alright? `,
  `Somebody called me, Dewey. I'm not making it up. `,
  `Sorry, police orders. I'll stay out of the way, I promise. `,
  `Sorry. `,
  `Sorry. `,
  `Sshh..it's okay. `,
  `Ssshh...everything's gonna be okay. I promise. `,
  `Stay away from her, Billy. `,
  `Stay away. `,
  `Steve's counting on you. `,
  `Stop it! `,
  `Stop right there. `,
  `Stop. Right there. `,
  `Stu was with me last night. `,
  `Stu...please...help me... `,
  `Stu's flipped out. He's gone mad. `,
  `Subtlety, Stu. Look it up. `,
  `Sure it does. It's like Jodie Foster in SILENCE OF THE LAMBS when she kept having flashbacks of her dead father. `,
  `Sure it is, Sid. It's all a movie. Life's one great big movie. Only you can't pick your genre. `,
  `Sure... `,
  `Surprise, Sidney. `,
  `Take a message. `,
  `Talk to me, Sid. `,
  `TATUM! `,
  `Tatum? `,
  `Telephone, dear. `,
  `Tell me, Kenny, has a cheesy tabloid journalist ever won the Pulitzer? `,
  `Tell that to Cotton Weary. You wouldn't believe how easy it was to frame him. `,
  `Tell your mom I said thanks. `,
  `Thank you, Hank. We're on it. What were you doing out at Sidney's tonight? `,
  `Thanks Randy. `,
  `Thanks, butt wart. You did good. `,
  `Thanks, Dewey. But with my luck they'd cast Tori Spelling. `,
  `Thanks, Tatum. `,
  `That all depends on you. `,
  `That fish smelled strong. `,
  `That ghost mask is sold at both Kroger's and WalMart. Neither of which keep purchase records. `,
  `That is so sexist. The killer could easily be female-BASIC INSTINCT. `,
  `That is so unoriginal. You disappoint me, Randy. `,
  `That was an ice pick-not exactly the same. `,
  `That's it, Billy. I can't take any more. I'm feeling woozy. `,
  `That's mature. `,
  `That's not what you said. `,
  `That's quite alright. If I may say so, ma'am, you're much prettier in person. `,
  `That's right and now that you're no longer a virgin. You gotta die--those are the rules. `,
  `That's the original part. `,
  `That's why she always lived. Only virgins can outsmart the killer in the big chase scene in the end. Don't you know the rules? `,
  `The blood's not the right color. Why do they do that? It's too red. `,
  `The control board's glitched. You know we can't carry a live picture. `,
  `The entire nation was shocked today by the teen murders in North Carolina... `,
  `The first one was, but the rest sucked. `,
  `THE FOG, TERROR TRAIN, PROM NIGHT --How come Jamie Lee Curtis is in all these movies? `,
  `The killer is still on the loose, isn't he? These murders are related. `,
  `The official term is "psychotic". `,
  `The phone's dead. `,
  `The police say I scared him off. It wasn't me, Sid. `,
  `The question is not who am I. The question is where am I? `,
  `The small town of Bayboro, North Carolina was devastated last night when two young teenagers were found brutally butchered.`,
  `Authorities have yet to issue a statement but our sources tell us that no arrest has been made and the murderer could strike again... `,
  `The State Bureau of Investigation has joined forces with local authorities to help catch what the Governor has called the most heinous... `,
  `The vultures are coming. Let's get you out of here. `,
  `The why'd the police let him go? `,
  `Then answer the question. Same category. `,
  `Then he dies. Right now. `,
  `Then what are you doing here? `,
  `Then what is it? Is there somebody else? `,
  `Then you should know Jason's MOTHER -Mrs.Vorhees was the original killer. Jason didn't show up until the sequel. `,
  `There are certain rules that one must abide by in order to successfully survive a horror movie.`,
  `1.You can never have sex. The minute you get a little nookie--you're as good as gone. Sex always equals death.`,
  `2. Never drink or do drugs. The sin factor. It's an extension of number one.`,
  `3. Never, ever, ever, under any circumstances, say "I'll be right back." `,
  `There are two doors to your house. A front door and a back one. If you answer correctly-you live. `,
  `There goes my chance with Sid. `,
  `There he goes folks--a dead man. Wave bye-bye. `,
  `There's always some stupid bullshit reason to kill your girlfriend. That's the beauty of it all. Simplicity. Besides, if it's too complicated you lose your target audience. `,
  `There's more. Guess what tomorrow is? The anniversary of his wife's death. It all fits. He's our man. `,
  `There's that sense of humor. I knew it still existed. Ohh, Sid, let's have some fun tonight. `,
  `They believe he's out of state by now. We'll keep roadblocks and curfew in effect through the night. If he's not picked up by morning--we'll do a house to house. `,
  `They didn't ask me if I like to hunt. `,
  `They don't know. Dewey said this is the worst crime they've ever seen. Even worse than... emotion	(stopping herself)`,
  `They think it's school-related? `,
  `They'd never make it in time. `,
  `They're pulling Loomis' account. But it'll be morning before we see something. You think he did it? `,
  `They've got 900 numbers for that. Seeya. `,
  `Think about it. On the off chance I get caught-a motive like that could divide a jury for years, don't you think?. You took my mother, so I took yours. Big sympathy factor.`,
  `Maternal abandonment causes serious deviant behavior. It certainly fucked you up. It made you have sex with a psychopath. `,
  `This could be good. What do you think, Sid? `,
  `This is a mistake. I shouldn't be here. `,
  `This is crazy. I didn't do it. `,
  `This is for my Mom, asshole. `,
  `This is gonna be fun, Sidney. Just like old times. `,
  `This is not the first time the small town of Bayboro has endured such tragedy. Only a year ago, Maureen Prescott, wife and mother, was found raped and murdered... `,
  `This is probably an inappropriate moment, but you think you'd want to maybe go out with me sometime... like on a date? `,
  `This is the best part, Sid. Billy's got it all figured out. Why do you think we kept your father alive so long? Why did we save you for last? `,
  `This morning several students, in what appears to be a prank, have been spotted wearing masks. School officials have yet to comment but this is the same type of mask worn by the killer... `,
  `This must be big news to be on INSIDE STORY. `,
  `Time to go, stud bucket. `,
  `Tits--see. `,
  `To apologize. `,
  `TO SEE WHAT YOUR INSIDES LOOK LIKE. `,
  `To talk. `,
  `Tomorrow. One year tomorrow. `,
  `Turn off the light. `,
  `Twenty years ago I woulda said not a chance. But these kids today...damn if I know. `,
  `Twenty-five, huh? In a demographic study I proved to be most popular amongst males, 11-24. I just missed you.`,
  `Of course, you don't look a day over twelve, except in the upper torso area. Does the force require that you work out? `,
  `Twice. `,
  `Two minutes tops. `,
  `Two students have been savagely murdered. And this is how we express our compassion and sensivity? `,
  `Uh...HALLOWEEN. You know, the one with the guy with the white mask who just sorta walks around and stalks the baby sitters. What's yours? `,
  `Uh...hi, Billy. `,
  `Uh...NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET. `,
  `Uh-huh, it's just...you know, the police and reporters...it brings it all back. `,
  `Uh-huh. `,
  `Uh-huh. `,
  `Uh-huh. `,
  `Uh-huh. `,
  `Understand what? That I got a girlfriend who would rather accuse me of being a psychopathic killer than touch me. `,
  `Use the back way. Avoid the circus. `,
  `Wait, Sidney, don't go... `,
  `Wait, wait, don't hang up. `,
  `Wait...I thought we were gonna go out. `,
  `Wanna another beer? `,
  `Wanna interview us? `,
  `Was that Sidney Prescott they took away? `,
  `Watch her. Don't let on--just keep your eyes out. `,
  `Watch the show, Sid. His basket is bigger than the one you're pushing. `,
  `We all know Sidney, Mr. Himbry. `,
  `We already played that game. You lost, remember? `,
  `We could be like two grief stricken students and we'll say really nice things about our good friends who were slaughtered senselessly. `,
  `We did your mom a favor, Sid. The woman was a slut bag whore who flashed her shit all over town like she was Sharon Stone or something. `,
  `We got him, Sheriff. Billy Loomis. `,
  `We gotta get back. Jesus. He's here. What the fuck is he doing here? `,
  `We had a run in the mass murder section. `,
  `We haven't located her Dad yet. `,
  `We haven't ruled out that possibil... `,
  `We throw on a mask and dance around campus just hoping someone else gets butchered before we get bored again. You're both expelled. `,
  `We were just getting to the good part. `,
  `We'll be brief, Sidney. The police have a few questions they'd like to ask you... `,
  `We'll find him, Sid. Don't worry. `,
  `Well it's bad. They're bringing in the feds. This is big. `,
  `Well, we can hope, can't we? We certainly don't have any leads. A ghost mask, a cellular phone--not much there. `,
  `Well...you can only hear that Richard Gere-gerbil story so many times before you have to start believing it.`,
  `Well..uh...yes ma'am. For the time being. `,
  `We're fine. Thanks. `,
  `We're gonna have to keep you, Billy. The governor's got SBI, FBI, and god knows who else on their way down here. `,
  `We're seeing a lot of you today. `,
  `We're tracking the cellular phone bill. `,
  `What about Gale Weathers? I sound like a meteorologist... `,
  `What about the cellular phone bill? `,
  `What am I doing? `,
  `What am I? The beer wench? `,
  `What are you doing here? `,
  `What are you doing here? `,
  `What are you doing here? `,
  `What are you doing with a cellular telephone, son? `,
  `What are you saying? That I killed her or something? `,
  `What brings you out to these parts? `,
  `What did Mama tell you? When I wear this badge you treat me like a man of the law. `,
  `What did you say? `,
  `What do I have to do to prove to you I'm not a killer? `,
  `What do you think about when you're having sex? `,
  `What do you think I said? `,
  `What do you want? `,
  `What do you want? `,
  `What door am I at? `,
  `What happened to her? `,
  `What happened? `,
  `What happened? `,
  `What happened? Oh God... `,
  `What if she did it? What if Sidney killed Casey and Steve? `,
  `What if your father snapped? Your mom's anniversary set him off and he went on a murder spree, killing everyone... `,
  `What is it? Where's Casey? `,
  `What is she doing here? `,
  `What is your problem? You got what you wanted. Cotton Weary is in jail. They're gonna gas him. A book is not gonna change that. `,
  `What kind of game? `,
  `What kind of lead? `,
  `What number are you trying to reach? `,
  `What number is this? `,
  `What rules? `,
  `What secret meaning? Like a Satanical thing? `,
  `What the... `,
  `What were you doing out here? `,
  `What? `,
  `What? `,
  `What? `,
  `What? `,
  `What? `,
  `What? `,
  `What? She asked. `,
  `What? What? `,
  `What? What? `,
  `What? You don't still think it's me? `,
  `Whatever. Just hurry. `,
  `What's going on in there? `,
  `What's going on? `,
  `What's his name? `,
  `What's Leatherface doing here? `,
  `What's that noise? `,
  `What's that? `,
  `What's that? `,
  `What's the delay? `,
  `What's the plan? `,
  `What's wrong? You look like you've seen a ghost. `,
  `What's your favorite scary movie? `,
  `What's your favorite scary movie? `,
  `When are you gonna let that go, Sid? When my mom left my dad--I just accepted it. This is the way it is. She's not coming back. `,
  `When did that ever stop you? You can't sit on this. This is huge. `,
  `When you're arrested-you're allowed one phone call? Who did you call? `,
  `Where are you? `,
  `Where do you get this shit? `,
  `Where is she? `,
  `Where is she? `,
  `Where the fuck did she go? `,
  `Where the fuck is it? `,
  `Where ya going? It's not over yet. We've got one more surprise--Stu, I believe it's your turn. `,
  `Where you guys been? We had to start without you. `,
  `Where'd she go? `,
  `Where'd she go? `,
  `Where'd you put it? `,
  `Which is it? `,
  `Which is you... `,
  `Who are you trying to reach? `,
  `Who are you? `,
  `Who are you? `,
  `Who did you call? `,
  `Who is it? `,
  `Who is this? `,
  `Who is this? `,
  `Who? `,
  `Who's there? `,
  `Who's there? `,
  `Who's up next? `,
  `Why are they doing this? `,
  `Why are you doing this? `,
  `Why are you doing this? `,
  `Why can't I be a Meg Ryan movie? `,
  `Why did you kill my mother? `,
  `Why do you want to know my name? `,
  `Why don't you want to talk to me? `,
  `Why would he want to kill his own girlfriend? `,
  `Why would she lie about it? `,
  `Why would Sidney want to be with Steve? She has her own bubble-butt boyfriend Billy. `,
  `Why would you call me from my front porch? `,
  `Why? WHY? Did you hear that, Stu? I think she wants a motive. Hmmm...I don't really believe in motives, Sid. I mean, did Norman Bates have a motive? `,
  `Why? You wanna ask me out? `,
  `With Stu, there's little time to stop and reflect. But sometimes before, to relax and get in the mood, I think about Grant Goodeve. `,
  `With that set of lungs--she should be. `,
  `Working, thank you. `,
  `Would you settle for a PG-13 relationship? `,
  `Yeah, Casey and Steve were completely hollowed out. Takes a man to do something like that. `,
  `Yeah, I'm off early--curfew you know. emotion	(looking off)`,
  `Yeah, it was edited for TV. All the good stuff was cut out and I started thinking about us and how two years ago, we started off kinda hot and heavy, a nice solid "R" rating on our way to an NC17.`,
  `And how things have changed and, lately, we're just sot of...edited for television. `,
  `Yeah, okay...whatever. `,
  `Yeah, Randy, she's getting mad. I think you better liver alone. `,
  `Yeah, that's not fair. `,
  `Yeah, we just watched a few movies. Took a few notes. It was fun. `,
  `Yeah, yeah, yeah... `,
  `Yeah, yeah...are you okay? `,
  `Yeah. `,
  `Yeah. `,
  `Yeah... `,
  `Yeah...and when I called no one answered. `,
  `Yeah...Freddy Krueger. `,
  `Yeah...I think so. `,
  `YES! `,
  `Yes, sir, sheriff. `,
  `Yes, sir. `,
  `Yes, sir. `,
  `Yes, that's right. `,
  `Yes, you doofus. `,
  `Yes. `,
  `Yes? `,
  `Yes? Hello? `,
  `Yo--let's rock. `,
  `You are not to be alone again. Is that clear? If you pee--I pee. `,
  `You are precious. Please, call me Gale. `,
  `You bitch--where the fuck are you? `,
  `You can't be here, Tatum. This is an official crime scene. `,
  `You can't prove a rumor. That's why it's a rumor. `,
  `You coming tonight? `,
  `You don't still think it was me? `,
  `You get it. `,
  `You getting scared? `,
  `You girls gonna have to hurry it up. We're under curfew. `,
  `You girls ready. `,
  `You gonna be able to come down to the station and talk to us a bit? `,
  `You got it. `,
  `You got some ideas of playing around, boy. `,
  `You guys can go up to my parents room? To talk and...whatever. `,
  `You have a few intimacy issues as a result of your mother's untimely death. It's no big deal. You'll thaw out. `,
  `You have to have a favorite. `,
  `You have to move on, Sid. `,
  `You have to play, Sid. Don't want to disappoint your dad. He's been waiting around all night. `,
  `You heard Billy-shut the fuck up. `,
  `You heard me. `,
  `You know if I were accused of carving up two people, I'd take the opportunity to skip school. `,
  `You know it. `,
  `You know that's not true. `,
  `You know what I hate most about horror movies? The final scene...it just goes on and on...and it gets so stupid... `,
  `You know what my dad will do to you? `,
  `You know what time it is, Sid? It's after midnight. It's your mother's anniversary. We killed her exactly one year ago today. `,
  `You little shit. `,
  `You lost your mom... `,
  `You never know when or where a story will break. `,
  `You never told me your name. `,
  `You okay? `,
  `You open your mouth and stupidity pours out. `,
  `You owe my mother. `,
  `You ready to party hard tonight? `,
  `You rode your bike out there? `,
  `You should never say "Who's there?". Don't you watch scary movies? It's a death wish. `,
  `You sick fucks--you've seen one too many movies. `,
  `You sleep in THAT? `,
  `You sure I can stay over? My dad won't be back til Sunday. `,
  `You take a knife and slit from the groin to the sternum. `,
  `You tell me your name, I'll tell you mine. `,
  `You tell me. `,
  `You think he could still be in town? `,
  `You tricked me... `,
  `You want to go live? `,
  `You were out last night? `,
  `You'll never get away with this. `,
  `Your call. `,
  `Your front porch. `,
  `Your mother's murder was last year's hottest court case. Somebody was gonna write a book about it. `,
  `Your objection is duly noted. `,
  `Your parents split up. It's not the same thing. Your mom left town, she's not in a coffin somewhere. `,
  `You're absolutely right. I'm the first to admit it. If this were a scary movie, I'd be the prime suspect. `,
  `You're crazy--both of you. `,
  `You're evil. `,
  `You're forgiven. Bye now. `,
  `You're making popcorn? `,
  `You're not so sure anymore, are you? `,
  `You're not supposed to be here, ma'am. `,
  `You're right. I'm cracking up. Ignore me. `,
  `You're such a little lap dog. He's got killer printed all over his forehead. `,
  `You're sure it was the Hilton? `,
